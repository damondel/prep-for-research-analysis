## ðŸ“‹ Demo Script & Talking Points

### Opening Hook
*"As researchers, we spend countless hours manually cleaning transcripts, removing personal information, and formatting data for analysis. What if I told you there's a way to automate this entire workflow in seconds?"*

### Problem Demonstration
*"Here's a typical VTT transcript from a user interview. Look at this mess - timestamps everywhere, speaker names exposed, fragmented text across multiple lines. This is what researchers deal with daily."*

### Solution Introduction
*"I built the Prep for Research Analysis MCP server to solve exactly this problem. It's a specialized tool that integrates directly with GitHub Copilot to transform messy transcripts into clean, anonymized, research-ready documents."*

### Live Demo Commentary
*"Watch this - I'll convert this entire transcript with a single command in GitHub Copilot Chat..."*

*"In just seconds, we've transformed a 6000-line VTT file into clean Markdown with anonymized speakers, proper formatting, and research metadata."*

### Advanced Features
*"But it goes beyond basic conversion. The tool can add YAML frontmatter for AI analysis tools, tag content for organization, and even convert screenshots and diagrams to text."*

### Integration Benefits
*"Because it's built on the Model Context Protocol, it integrates seamlessly with your existing VS Code and GitHub Copilot workflow. No context switching, no external tools."*

### Impact Statement
*"This isn't just about saving time - it's about enabling better research. Clean, anonymized data that's ready for AI analysis from day one."*

## ðŸŽ¥ Recording Tips

### Screen Setup
1. **Clean desktop** - remove distractions
2. **Large fonts** - 14pt+ for readability
3. **Dark theme** - easier on viewers' eyes
4. **Full screen** - hide unnecessary UI elements

### File Preparation
1. **Sample VTT file** - realistic but not too long for demo
2. **Clear naming** - use descriptive filenames
3. **Backup commands** - have them ready to copy/paste

### Pacing
- **Speak slowly** - viewers need time to absorb
- **Pause after results** - let viewers see the output
- **Explain what's happening** - narrate each step

### Technical Setup
- **Test audio** - clear, no background noise
- **Stable screen recording** - 60fps if possible
- **Zoom appropriately** - ensure text is readable
