### Problem üîß

Today, discovering what's possible in Arc Center is unevenly distributed across the IA.

Some elements are doing the heavy lifting (ToC), while others are not fully realizing their opportunities (Get started, L2 overview, etc.).

### Initiative ‚öñÔ∏è

Recommit to the ToC as a wayfinding guide based on core JTBD

Re-develop other surfaces to promote discovery and help connect the dots across offerings

Formalize the process for deciding what goes where and why

### Consumer üë§

Visitors will be better positioned to effectively navigate the Arc Center experience and discover things relevant to their JTBD.

Product owners with experiences in Arc Center will have clarity on where and how their experience should show up.

### Test üìä

Product owners will review, pilot and provide feedback on updated ToC guidance.

Customers will review early concepts.

Telemetry will help monitor impact of changes.
