<v Christopher Swatty>Well, not the most efficient systems ever.
So looking to leverage.</v>

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:24.879
<v David Mondello>How do you remember how arc first came to
your attention?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1069-0
00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:28.592

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:36.820
<v Christopher Swatty>When I first inherited the VM realm,
you know V Center V sphere,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1100-1
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:42.479
<v Christopher Swatty>all the clients just looking to to figure
out how to more effectively manage it.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1104-0
00:09:42.919 --> 00:09:43.559

<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1115-0
00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:48.569
<v Christopher Swatty>I've got a really small team,
so leveraging tool sets to, you know,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1115-1
00:09:48.569 --> 00:09:49.159

00:09:56.384 --> 00:10:00.739
<v Christopher Swatty>looking at looking at improving
day-to-day operational steps.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1159-0
00:10:02.119 --> 00:10:06.871
<v Christopher Swatty>So any way that we can get in and manage
those resources better is is a good thing.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1159-1
00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:10.039
<v Christopher Swatty>Plus like I said,
as we first started talking about it.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1164-0
00:10:10.229 --> 00:10:14.829

00:10:16.359 --> 00:10:18.832
<v Christopher Swatty>Not huge. You know,
from an enterprise perspective,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1180-1
00:10:18.832 --> 00:10:20.639
<v Christopher Swatty>we're not monstrous. We got thousands.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1182-0
00:10:21.109 --> 00:10:21.309

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1211-0
00:10:21.439 --> 00:10:25.054
<v Christopher Swatty>Not 10s of thousands or hundreds of
thousands of instances,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1190-0
00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:23.789

00:10:25.054 --> 00:10:29.875
<v Christopher Swatty>but with Broadcom changing their their
their structure, right? Everybody knows.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1207-0
00:10:29.259 --> 00:10:29.939

00:10:31.119 --> 00:10:33.919
<v Christopher Swatty>Broadcom got really pretty stupid.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1219-0
00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:35.839
<v Christopher Swatty>And they changed.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1223-0
00:10:36.199 --> 00:10:38.039
<v Christopher Swatty>They changed their licensing structure
too.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1225-0
00:10:38.689 --> 00:10:38.889
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

<v Christopher Swatty>Forcing companies like us into things.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1248-0
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:47.474
<v Christopher Swatty>Is that we don't need fully loaded
licenses that we may use 10% of you know</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1248-1
00:10:47.474 --> 00:10:49.189
<v Christopher Swatty>what's available, so.</v>

00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:57.090
<v Christopher Swatty>That I think managing our existing VM and
then when looking at Hyper V and looking</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1284-1
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.510
<v Christopher Swatty>to get deeper into the the Microsoft
stack,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1284-2
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.319
<v Christopher Swatty>that's what really drove my curiosity
about Ark.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1285-0
00:11:04.619 --> 00:11:05.059

00:11:06.539 --> 00:11:09.847
<v David Mondello>Thanks for that response.
As you started to play around with arc</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1320-1
00:11:09.847 --> 00:11:13.816
<v David Mondello>and he was trying to kind of evaluate
whether or not it was going to help you</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1320-2
00:11:13.816 --> 00:11:16.819
<v David Mondello>in some of those things that you were
looking to optimize.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1337-0
00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:22.574
<v David Mondello>What were you using to as criteria to
sort of evaluate its utility for you</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1337-1
00:11:22.574 --> 00:11:23.319

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1354-0
00:11:24.419 --> 00:11:29.698
<v Christopher Swatty>So when I start messing around with new
tool sets or looking at other resources,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1349-0
00:11:28.379 --> 00:11:28.579
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

00:11:29.698 --> 00:11:31.719
<v Christopher Swatty>I just I go in kind of blindly.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1355-0
00:11:32.189 --> 00:11:32.389
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1361-0
00:11:32.469 --> 00:11:33.189
<v Christopher Swatty>Yeah, I like.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1377-0
00:11:33.189 --> 00:11:36.768
<v Christopher Swatty>I like to not know sometimes a lot about
the solution.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1377-1
00:11:36.768 --> 00:11:41.389
<v Christopher Swatty>When you start to play with it,
because that forces a deeper level of.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1382-0
00:11:42.919 --> 00:11:44.239
<v Christopher Swatty>Research, if you will.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1420-0
00:11:44.239 --> 00:11:48.713
<v Christopher Swatty>I mean it digging into hey,
what does this do and how can I better</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1420-1
00:11:48.713 --> 00:11:52.252
<v Christopher Swatty>leverage it?
And you know the Kubernetes and and the</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1420-2
00:11:52.252 --> 00:11:55.992
<v Christopher Swatty>managing hybrid assets, right,
because a lot of people,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1420-3
00:11:55.992 --> 00:11:59.799
<v Christopher Swatty>well this company. Anyways,
we went into the cloud very.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1430-0
00:12:04.739 --> 00:12:07.939
<v Christopher Swatty>Enthusiastically I guess since the term
and so a lot.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1432-0
00:12:06.099 --> 00:12:07.419
<v David Mondello>Hmm, OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1437-0
00:12:07.939 --> 00:12:09.299
<v Christopher Swatty>A lot of companies jumped in the cloud.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1446-0
00:12:09.299 --> 00:12:11.019
<v Christopher Swatty>It's like Cloud's brilliant. Let's go.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1452-0
00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:13.379
<v Christopher Swatty>And then the bills start to hit.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1457-0
00:12:14.299 --> 00:12:16.339
<v Christopher Swatty>So it's exceedingly expensive.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1461-0
00:12:16.379 --> 00:12:18.219
<v Christopher Swatty>It's somebody else's data center.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1464-0
00:12:18.339 --> 00:12:19.059
<v Christopher Swatty>It's just not.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1468-0
00:12:19.059 --> 00:12:19.859
<v Christopher Swatty>That's all it is.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1471-0
00:12:19.859 --> 00:12:21.299
<v Christopher Swatty>So when you look at.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1492-0
00:12:23.039 --> 00:12:26.983
<v Christopher Swatty>Making a hybrid environment,
which we really are from a compute and</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1492-1
00:12:26.983 --> 00:12:29.999
<v Christopher Swatty>certainly from my side,
from a storage perspective.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1499-0
00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:34.279
<v Christopher Swatty>Looking into managing those resources.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1534-0
00:12:34.669 --> 00:12:39.822
<v Christopher Swatty>And then leveraging the VM,
the VM realm we also we also used it to</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1534-1
00:12:39.822 --> 00:12:45.961
<v Christopher Swatty>start to help us choose what to get out
of from AVM perspective because a lot of</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1534-2
00:12:45.961 --> 00:12:49.069
<v Christopher Swatty>a lot of what we have was over provision.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1536-0
00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.589
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1538-0
00:12:49.429 --> 00:12:50.989
<v Christopher Swatty>So my predecessor.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1545-0
00:12:52.599 --> 00:12:54.199
<v Christopher Swatty>Bought Ferraris when we needed
Volkswagens.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1557-0
00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:56.319
<v Christopher Swatty>That's the best analogy, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1549-0
00:12:54.589 --> 00:12:54.789
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1559-0
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:57.109
<v David Mondello>Sure. Yeah, yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1572-0
00:12:56.399 --> 00:13:02.548
<v Christopher Swatty>So so we got, you know,
16 core that are running print servers</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1572-1
00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:03.719
<v Christopher Swatty>and DNS and.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1580-0
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:07.509
<v Christopher Swatty>What I call utility boxes.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1585-0
00:13:07.869 --> 00:13:09.789
<v Christopher Swatty>They're not highly transactional.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1593-0
00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.029
<v Christopher Swatty>You don't need that many Cpu's. You don't.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1615-0
00:13:12.029 --> 00:13:14.761
<v Christopher Swatty>It's not calculating a lot of data.
It's not doing, you know.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1615-1
00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:17.229
<v Christopher Swatty>It's like the difference between word and
Excel, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1639-0
00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:21.054
<v Christopher Swatty>So Excel,
Excel needs a lot of horsepower sometimes,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1614-0
00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:17.959
<v David Mondello>Sure.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1639-1
00:13:21.054 --> 00:13:26.250
<v Christopher Swatty>depending on what you're doing,
because it's it's it's manipulating and</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1639-2
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:30.869
<v Christopher Swatty>calculating a lot of data,
whereas you know a word application.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1642-0
00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:31.879
<v Christopher Swatty>Is just.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1645-0
00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:33.119
<v Christopher Swatty>It's just a a whiteboard.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1655-0
00:13:33.959 --> 00:13:35.519
<v Christopher Swatty>Basically, you're just typing into it.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1654-0
00:13:34.699 --> 00:13:35.099
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1659-0
00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:36.559
<v Christopher Swatty>It's not really thinking.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1662-0
00:13:36.559 --> 00:13:38.599
<v Christopher Swatty>It's not doing anything so.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1672-0
00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:42.439
<v Christopher Swatty>That really helped us to shave down.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1684-0
00:13:42.439 --> 00:13:45.889
<v Christopher Swatty>So we went from,
I'm just looking at a number.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1684-1
00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:48.679
<v Christopher Swatty>We went from 2800 cores to about 1200.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1686-0
00:13:49.409 --> 00:13:49.529
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1690-0
00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:51.559
<v Christopher Swatty>Just for my environment.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1712-0
00:13:53.319 --> 00:13:58.255
<v Christopher Swatty>And then the next step obviously is gonna
be getting into Hyper V and so using</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1712-1
00:13:58.255 --> 00:14:01.629
<v Christopher Swatty>leveraging,
you know a management plane resource like</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1712-2
00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:01.879
<v Christopher Swatty>ARC.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1718-0
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.969
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1725-0
00:14:02.469 --> 00:14:04.989
<v Christopher Swatty>Really,
really helps us to to take a look at the.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1729-0
00:14:05.429 --> 00:14:06.869
<v Christopher Swatty>Take a look at the environment.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1748-0
00:14:06.909 --> 00:14:11.941
<v Christopher Swatty>Determine how we can approach it and then
obviously you know the management piece</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1748-1
00:14:11.941 --> 00:14:14.580
<v Christopher Swatty>too,
breaking it down across multiple data</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1748-2
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.869
<v Christopher Swatty>centers and colos so.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1765-0
00:14:17.359 --> 00:14:20.083
<v Christopher Swatty>Yeah,
it looking looking at getting smarter,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1765-1
00:14:20.083 --> 00:14:24.199
<v Christopher Swatty>especially especially while getting away
from Broadcom like I said.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1774-0
00:14:25.469 --> 00:14:27.469
<v David Mondello>That's a good thank you so much for that
response.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1776-0
00:14:27.469 --> 00:14:28.269
<v David Mondello>That's that's great.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1790-0
00:14:29.759 --> 00:14:32.799
<v David Mondello>And do you mind just briefly before I
leave this topic talking a little bit</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1790-1
00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:33.199
<v David Mondello>about you?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1792-0
00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:34.999
<v David Mondello>You mentioned how kind of.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1811-0
00:14:37.359 --> 00:14:40.799
<v David Mondello>Repositioning how you were using getting
closer to Volkswagens from Ferraris?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1838-0
00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:45.164
<v David Mondello>Is there anything that that arc
specifically allowed you to learn about</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1838-1
00:14:45.164 --> 00:14:49.772
<v David Mondello>your inventory that helped you get to
that spot where you were maybe better</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1838-2
00:14:49.772 --> 00:14:52.319
<v David Mondello>positioned for what you were trying to do?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1846-0
00:14:53.119 --> 00:14:55.679
<v Christopher Swatty>I think leveraging site manager helped.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1847-0
00:14:55.589 --> 00:14:56.549
<v David Mondello>Oh, OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1850-0
00:14:56.319 --> 00:14:57.479
<v Christopher Swatty>It's a, it's.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1867-0
00:14:59.919 --> 00:15:04.593
<v Christopher Swatty>So the management plan is very important
when you're managing enterprise level</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1867-1
00:15:04.593 --> 00:15:05.599
<v Christopher Swatty>resources, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1880-0
00:15:05.599 --> 00:15:09.479
<v Christopher Swatty>They're spread out geographically, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1876-0
00:15:08.709 --> 00:15:09.269
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm. Yep.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1890-0
00:15:09.479 --> 00:15:11.849
<v Christopher Swatty>Plus,
we've got the hybrid components with the</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1890-1
00:15:11.849 --> 00:15:12.959
<v Christopher Swatty>cloud connections, so.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1903-0
00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:17.943
<v Christopher Swatty>I think leveraging site manager really
really helped us.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1903-1
00:15:17.943 --> 00:15:19.719
<v Christopher Swatty>Take a look at our environment.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1906-0
00:15:22.759 --> 00:15:23.319
<v Christopher Swatty>And determine.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1911-0
00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:24.629
<v Christopher Swatty>What makes the most sense?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1949-0
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:30.650
<v Christopher Swatty>Because when you throw geography in there,
you have so many variables that include</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1949-1
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:35.510
<v Christopher Swatty>Wan connections, your routing,
switching the the actual the actual</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1949-2
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:40.008
<v Christopher Swatty>networks themselves,
and then determining where should we put</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1937-0
00:15:37.089 --> 00:15:37.289
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1949-3
00:15:40.008 --> 00:15:41.749
<v Christopher Swatty>our resources, you know.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1948-0
00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:41.849
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1960-0
00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:44.879
<v Christopher Swatty>Plus,
this is a it's a manufacturing company.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1981-0
00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:47.583
<v Christopher Swatty>So we've got our sites have typical
office,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1981-1
00:15:47.583 --> 00:15:51.945
<v Christopher Swatty>but then we have office that's combined
like here in Tempe with a huge</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1981-2
00:15:51.945 --> 00:15:53.359
<v Christopher Swatty>manufacturing facility.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/1983-0
00:15:54.199 --> 00:15:54.399
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2012-0
00:15:54.429 --> 00:15:59.771
<v Christopher Swatty>So our resource allocation where we
physically put things where we run these</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2012-1
00:15:59.771 --> 00:16:03.309
<v Christopher Swatty>resources,
how we manage them across the Wan links</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2012-2
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:06.709
<v Christopher Swatty>is very important because it impacts
everything.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2020-0
00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:10.269
<v Christopher Swatty>It impacts performance,
it impacts the cost of the the circuits.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2033-0
00:16:12.039 --> 00:16:17.719
<v Christopher Swatty>And having so it's kind of like the way I
look at it. The way I look at.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2043-0
00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:26.549
<v Christopher Swatty>This sort of structure is kinda like
manufacturing and logistics.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2063-0
00:16:26.709 --> 00:16:29.589
<v Christopher Swatty>Right.
You wanna you wanna kinda put your</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2047-0
00:16:27.079 --> 00:16:27.279
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2063-1
00:16:29.589 --> 00:16:34.937
<v Christopher Swatty>manufacturing near where your logistic
base is as well as your customer base,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2056-0
00:16:32.769 --> 00:16:33.129
<v David Mondello>Sure.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2063-2
00:16:34.937 --> 00:16:35.349
<v Christopher Swatty>right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2066-0
00:16:35.099 --> 00:16:35.299
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2104-0
00:16:35.349 --> 00:16:39.789
<v Christopher Swatty>So you're trying to save money trying to
save time and that in that scenario,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2104-1
00:16:39.789 --> 00:16:43.034
<v Christopher Swatty>in this scenario,
we're trying to save money in terms of</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2104-2
00:16:43.034 --> 00:16:47.475
<v Christopher Swatty>the circuits, the the fully loaded,
you know network and all the requirements</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2089-0
00:16:43.559 --> 00:16:43.999
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2104-3
00:16:47.475 --> 00:16:50.549
<v Christopher Swatty>for this plus the speed, you know,
the latency if we.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2107-0
00:16:49.659 --> 00:16:49.859
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2112-0
00:16:50.549 --> 00:16:52.509
<v Christopher Swatty>Can drop 3 hops from.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2121-0
00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:56.999
<v Christopher Swatty>From system to user or or system to data.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2127-0
00:16:57.429 --> 00:16:58.509
<v Christopher Swatty>To user right.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2133-0
00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:01.189
<v Christopher Swatty>Because our data isn't necessarily the
storage.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2130-0
00:16:58.929 --> 00:16:59.129
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2145-0
00:17:02.719 --> 00:17:05.759
<v Christopher Swatty>Won't necessarily be in the same location
as those VMS.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2147-0
00:17:06.279 --> 00:17:07.039
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2159-0
00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.830
<v Christopher Swatty>So architecture is really,
really important.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2159-1
00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:13.199
<v Christopher Swatty>I mean that's a long answer, but.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2165-0
00:17:14.019 --> 00:17:15.579
<v David Mondello>No, I think it's very rebellious.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2172-0
00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.739
<v David Mondello>It's helpful 'cause it you touched on.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2200-0
00:17:17.739 --> 00:17:21.286
<v David Mondello>You know what specifically with with
Anarch helped you understand your</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2200-1
00:17:21.286 --> 00:17:23.884
<v David Mondello>inventory a little bit better and and
specifically,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2200-2
00:17:23.884 --> 00:17:27.981
<v David Mondello>you know it sounds like site manager was
instructive in that way and specifically</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2200-3
00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:30.979
<v David Mondello>what allowed you to do so that that I
think that was great.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2231-0
00:17:32.479 --> 00:17:36.128
<v David Mondello>The last thing before we start to get
into the the concepts of wondering if we</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2231-1
00:17:36.128 --> 00:17:39.316
<v David Mondello>can talk a little bit about,
you mentioned your approach to learning</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2231-2
00:17:39.316 --> 00:17:42.319
<v David Mondello>any sort of new tool set as kind of going
in with a blank slate.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2257-0
00:17:42.589 --> 00:17:46.406
<v David Mondello>And how that sort of force you to to
learn or kind of think a little bit</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2239-0
00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:43.239
<v Christopher Swatty>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2257-1
00:17:46.406 --> 00:17:49.909
<v David Mondello>deeper than maybe you would with any sort
of preconceived notions?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2294-0
00:17:50.709 --> 00:17:55.179
<v David Mondello>I'm wondering if you could talk,
maybe reflect a little bit on your your</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2294-1
00:17:55.179 --> 00:18:00.201
<v David Mondello>approach to arc in that way and was there
anything that was really helpful within</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2294-2
00:18:00.201 --> 00:18:05.223
<v David Mondello>the experience to get you up to speed or
was there anything that was missing from</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2297-0
00:18:05.069 --> 00:18:05.749
<v Christopher Swatty>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2294-3
00:18:05.223 --> 00:18:06.999
<v David Mondello>the experience that that you?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2304-0
00:18:06.999 --> 00:18:08.309
<v David Mondello>Would have liked to have seen those two.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2313-0
00:18:07.839 --> 00:18:08.839
<v Christopher Swatty>So there was.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2307-0
00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:08.669
<v David Mondello>Kind of.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2312-0
00:18:08.749 --> 00:18:09.669
<v David Mondello>Those are the kinds.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2323-0
00:18:08.919 --> 00:18:12.879
<v Christopher Swatty>I mean so it so it sounds kind of strange
that go in without any.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2330-0
00:18:12.919 --> 00:18:14.479
<v Christopher Swatty>We don't have a benchmark, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2366-0
00:18:14.479 --> 00:18:17.608
<v Christopher Swatty>So we go in there and start to dig into
it,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2333-0
00:18:15.159 --> 00:18:15.559
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2366-1
00:18:17.608 --> 00:18:20.879
<v Christopher Swatty>not knowing what's where to learn the
system.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2366-2
00:18:20.879 --> 00:18:26.710
<v Christopher Swatty>And then from there you build a A compare
and contrast framework between that and</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2359-0
00:18:24.869 --> 00:18:25.069
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2366-3
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.559
<v Christopher Swatty>like AV Center, right, so.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2378-0
00:18:30.279 --> 00:18:35.639
<v Christopher Swatty>What functionality does does ARCA have
versus V Center and how does that touch?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2388-0
00:18:35.989 --> 00:18:39.257
<v Christopher Swatty>Our environment,
well-being our environment is highly,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2388-1
00:18:39.257 --> 00:18:40.149
<v Christopher Swatty>is very hybrid.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2393-0
00:18:41.839 --> 00:18:43.679
<v Christopher Swatty>Our provided a a more.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2430-0
00:18:45.399 --> 00:18:50.066
<v Christopher Swatty>A broader visual of our of the
architecture of our systems.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2430-1
00:18:50.066 --> 00:18:54.889
<v Christopher Swatty>So our physical assets,
really the virtual world and then how</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2430-2
00:18:54.889 --> 00:19:00.334
<v Christopher Swatty>they connect and how they relate to the
cloud bits. So cloud storage,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2415-0
00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:55.669
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2430-3
00:19:00.334 --> 00:19:02.279
<v Christopher Swatty>cloud compute as well as.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2438-0
00:19:03.999 --> 00:19:06.159
<v Christopher Swatty>As well as the physical and the the
virtual machines.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2452-0
00:19:06.989 --> 00:19:13.156
<v Christopher Swatty>The that's one thing I think that art
provides and we're a huge Microsoft shop</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2452-1
00:19:13.156 --> 00:19:13.469
<v Christopher Swatty>too.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2457-0
00:19:13.469 --> 00:19:15.229
<v Christopher Swatty>I mean, I've got a level set with that,
right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2466-0
00:19:15.229 --> 00:19:16.349
<v Christopher Swatty>So we're a huge Microsoft.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2468-0
00:19:16.349 --> 00:19:17.549
<v Christopher Swatty>That's why we're going to Hyper V.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2483-0
00:19:19.079 --> 00:19:23.320
<v Christopher Swatty>But it provided a better view than
Broadcom does because Broadcom is very</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2483-1
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.639
<v Christopher Swatty>product centric, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2487-0
00:19:24.639 --> 00:19:26.439
<v Christopher Swatty>It's looking at their VM realm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2491-0
00:19:26.479 --> 00:19:27.119
<v Christopher Swatty>It doesn't.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2510-0
00:19:27.319 --> 00:19:31.830
<v Christopher Swatty>There are some cloud connectivity
components that you can add to it and</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2510-1
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:36.279
<v Christopher Swatty>expand from and and you know tool sets,
but it's not as comprehensive.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2514-0
00:19:36.589 --> 00:19:37.109
<v Christopher Swatty>I think.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2513-0
00:19:36.699 --> 00:19:36.819
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2522-0
00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:42.519
<v Christopher Swatty>And that plus are the two the two realms.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2527-0
00:19:42.519 --> 00:19:44.439
<v Christopher Swatty>I'm infrastructure.
I'm physical infrastructure.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2542-0
00:19:44.439 --> 00:19:48.168
<v Christopher Swatty>So there's a cloud,
there's a whole cloud team that manages</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2531-0
00:19:44.959 --> 00:19:45.159
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2542-1
00:19:48.168 --> 00:19:49.039
<v Christopher Swatty>cloud compute.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2551-0
00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:52.239
<v Christopher Swatty>We do touch in terms of storage, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2569-0
00:19:52.239 --> 00:19:55.624
<v Christopher Swatty>So we're leveraging that,
but in terms of compute and application</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2549-0
00:19:52.299 --> 00:19:52.499
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2569-1
00:19:55.624 --> 00:19:58.599
<v Christopher Swatty>deployment, all those other things,
there's another team.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2572-0
00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:00.039
<v Christopher Swatty>So what?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2577-0
00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:03.159
<v Christopher Swatty>What arc has done is enable us to better.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2580-0
00:20:06.069 --> 00:20:07.149
<v Christopher Swatty>It's the best word.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2582-0
00:20:09.479 --> 00:20:09.879
<v Christopher Swatty>Connect.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2585-0
00:20:10.889 --> 00:20:11.089
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2596-0
00:20:15.439 --> 00:20:15.559
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2598-0
00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:15.909
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2607-0
00:20:16.229 --> 00:20:21.109
<v Christopher Swatty>Av Center would be VM specific and it
would just be my realm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2629-0
00:20:21.109 --> 00:20:23.502
<v Christopher Swatty>It won't necessarily take in the cloud
components.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2629-1
00:20:23.502 --> 00:20:27.349
<v Christopher Swatty>The storage in the compute that the that
the rest of the Windows teams are doing.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2631-0
00:20:27.429 --> 00:20:28.909
<v Christopher Swatty>So this really help.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2644-0
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:33.629
<v Christopher Swatty>I think it helped more collaboration,
I think is the word.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2642-0
00:20:33.059 --> 00:20:33.339
<v David Mondello>Hmm, OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2646-0
00:20:33.629 --> 00:20:34.429
<v Christopher Swatty>I think that's the word.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2651-0
00:20:35.179 --> 00:20:36.259
<v David Mondello>Perfect. That's again.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2654-0
00:20:36.259 --> 00:20:37.739
<v David Mondello>Thank you for that. Very thoughtful.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2673-0
00:20:39.719 --> 00:20:42.058
<v David Mondello>Response.
I think just one last thing before we</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2673-1
00:20:42.058 --> 00:20:43.959
<v David Mondello>transition over to the to the concepts.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2709-0
00:20:43.999 --> 00:20:48.186
<v David Mondello>So that seems like something that you
found to be very useful for arc within</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2709-1
00:20:48.186 --> 00:20:52.157
<v David Mondello>your organization as being able to
facilitate that collaboration between</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2709-2
00:20:52.157 --> 00:20:56.399
<v David Mondello>teams that that kind of connect in
certain ways on the resources they manage.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2728-0
00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:59.217
<v David Mondello>Was there anything that as you explored
arc,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2728-1
00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:03.625
<v David Mondello>you were kind of wanting that you didn't
discover or that would have been helpful</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2728-2
00:21:03.625 --> 00:21:05.399
<v David Mondello>and maybe gotten you up to speed?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2739-0
00:21:05.709 --> 00:21:10.429
<v David Mondello>Little bit faster that you had to maybe
dig for through other sources.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2743-0
00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:11.489
<v Christopher Swatty>I think so.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2748-0
00:21:11.529 --> 00:21:13.529
<v Christopher Swatty>So I'm big on notifications, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2751-0
00:21:13.479 --> 00:21:14.159
<v David Mondello>OK, OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2752-0
00:21:13.569 --> 00:21:14.289
<v Christopher Swatty>I'm big on.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2775-0
00:21:14.289 --> 00:21:18.460
<v Christopher Swatty>I'm big on monitoring and thread setting
thresholds for notifications,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2775-1
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.809
<v Christopher Swatty>so I think it's probably my lack of
understanding of it.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2767-0
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.349
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2800-0
00:21:21.809 --> 00:21:25.560
<v Christopher Swatty>But when you look at capacity planning,
when you look at because it's got the</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2800-1
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.638
<v Christopher Swatty>Linux bits, it's got the virtual bits,
it's got the cloud bits,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2800-2
00:21:28.638 --> 00:21:29.889
<v Christopher Swatty>it's got all those things.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2801-0
00:21:30.089 --> 00:21:30.609
<v Christopher Swatty>But when?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2804-0
00:21:30.609 --> 00:21:31.729
<v Christopher Swatty>When you look at.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2812-0
00:21:34.079 --> 00:21:38.279
<v Christopher Swatty>Leveraging resources and tracking your
resources because.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2816-0
00:21:38.629 --> 00:21:40.149
<v Christopher Swatty>Like I said our previous.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2821-0
00:21:41.639 --> 00:21:42.599
<v Christopher Swatty>And actually, we're still going through.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2862-0
00:21:42.999 --> 00:21:48.980
<v Christopher Swatty>We're going through the big migration
with with with Hyper V but the previous</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2862-1
00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:54.424
<v Christopher Swatty>management was over provisioned so to be
able to track and right size,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2862-2
00:21:54.424 --> 00:22:00.558
<v Christopher Swatty>but the notification bit I think it's
just as important or more so important to</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2856-0
00:22:00.219 --> 00:22:00.419
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2862-3
00:22:00.558 --> 00:22:03.319
<v Christopher Swatty>to have the system say hey look you.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2864-0
00:22:03.319 --> 00:22:03.359
<v Christopher Swatty>Know what?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2870-0
00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:07.199
<v Christopher Swatty>You're at 5% utilization on this?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2878-0
00:22:08.129 --> 00:22:09.169
<v Christopher Swatty>But you've got other.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2903-0
00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:12.451
<v Christopher Swatty>You've got other environments or other
service,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2903-1
00:22:12.451 --> 00:22:18.127
<v Christopher Swatty>whether the physical servers or you know
the Linux or the VM or the cloud that are</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2890-0
00:22:14.519 --> 00:22:14.719
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2903-2
00:22:18.127 --> 00:22:19.769
<v Christopher Swatty>pushing 80 percent, 90%.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2902-0
00:22:19.719 --> 00:22:19.799
<v David Mondello>Mm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2919-0
00:22:19.769 --> 00:22:24.001
<v Christopher Swatty>So what does it look like from a
utilization perspective across the board</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2919-1
00:22:24.001 --> 00:22:25.889
<v Christopher Swatty>and are you best using resources?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2925-0
00:22:25.889 --> 00:22:28.569
<v Christopher Swatty>To me, that's really important because.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2924-0
00:22:28.419 --> 00:22:28.539
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2935-0
00:22:29.999 --> 00:22:32.399
<v Christopher Swatty>COVID created a lot of challenges for
companies, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2937-0
00:22:32.229 --> 00:22:33.029
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2939-0
00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:34.399
<v Christopher Swatty>No, no surprise.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2942-0
00:22:36.079 --> 00:22:36.639
<v Christopher Swatty>Cost control.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2945-0
00:22:36.639 --> 00:22:37.599
<v Christopher Swatty>Cost management cost.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2956-0
00:22:37.949 --> 00:22:42.989
<v Christopher Swatty>Avoidance is a large part of what
happened, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2991-0
00:22:44.479 --> 00:22:47.957
<v Christopher Swatty>And and trying to get smarter with what
you're doing,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2991-1
00:22:47.957 --> 00:22:52.079
<v Christopher Swatty>not just facilities and like how is it
that was at Wells Fargo,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2991-2
00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:57.361
<v Christopher Swatty>I was an AVP over network implementation
over there and Wells Fargo as a bank you</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2991-3
00:22:57.361 --> 00:23:01.999
<v Christopher Swatty>probably saw they started closing the
retail branches because they fig.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/2996-0
00:23:01.499 --> 00:23:01.619
<v David Mondello>MMM.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3005-0
00:23:01.999 --> 00:23:04.839
<v Christopher Swatty>Out it's like, wait, we don't need this,
right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3013-0
00:23:05.239 --> 00:23:08.279
<v Christopher Swatty>We've had we've got mobile ability,
we've gotms.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3007-0
00:23:05.489 --> 00:23:05.689
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3033-0
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:12.631
<v Christopher Swatty>We got all this stuff that people can
access,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3033-1
00:23:12.631 --> 00:23:17.589
<v Christopher Swatty>so that's similar to what we do too,
because I've got 450 servers out there.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3035-0

00:23:19.759 --> 00:23:25.973
<v Christopher Swatty>Being able to see them those instances
the the Linux figure out what's running</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3057-1
00:23:25.973 --> 00:23:29.119

00:23:29.799 --> 00:23:34.471
<v Christopher Swatty>This isn't proprietary,
but we are seriously challenged when it</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3073-1
00:23:34.471 --> 00:23:38.559
<v Christopher Swatty>comes to cmbb,
so a content management database, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3075-0

00:23:46.019 --> 00:23:48.339
<v Christopher Swatty>What applications are running in those
environments?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3099-0
00:23:48.499 --> 00:23:51.299
<v Christopher Swatty>And then who are the customers?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3107-0
00:23:51.299 --> 00:23:53.779
<v Christopher Swatty>So when we have an instance where.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3105-0
00:23:52.499 --> 00:23:52.619
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

00:23:55.199 --> 00:23:56.639
<v Christopher Swatty>We have a system that goes down.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3139-0
00:23:56.759 --> 00:24:00.520

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:04.629
<v Christopher Swatty>more aptly have the information
beforehand to know if this system goes</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3139-2
00:24:04.629 --> 00:24:04.919
<v Christopher Swatty>down.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3143-0
00:24:04.959 --> 00:24:06.319
<v Christopher Swatty>This is what's gonna be impacted.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3146-0
00:24:06.319 --> 00:24:07.599
<v Christopher Swatty>It's gonna impact revenue.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3151-0
00:24:07.179 --> 00:24:07.659

00:24:07.949 --> 00:24:10.869
<v Christopher Swatty>It's gonna impact. You know,
we're a huge Oracle shop too.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3166-0
00:24:10.869 --> 00:24:13.309
<v Christopher Swatty>We've got SQL out there,
but we're a huge Oracle shop.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3165-0
00:24:12.449 --> 00:24:12.649

<v Christopher Swatty>You know, is it impacting SAP?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3178-0
00:24:15.799 --> 00:24:18.599
<v Christopher Swatty>Is it? Is it impacting manufacturing?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3194-0
00:24:18.959 --> 00:24:24.213
<v Christopher Swatty>We've got some systems that that manage
the workflow process for our</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3180-0
00:24:19.089 --> 00:24:19.289

00:24:24.213 --> 00:24:25.279
<v Christopher Swatty>manufacturing.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3199-0
00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:28.519
<v Christopher Swatty>So in their combination between BM and
Linux.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3201-0
00:24:29.289 --> 00:24:29.489

00:24:30.359 --> 00:24:32.799
<v Christopher Swatty>And obviously physical boxes in there too.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3220-0
00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:38.406
<v Christopher Swatty>So I wanna know what those look like and
if they're starting to bounce off</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3220-1
00:24:38.406 --> 00:24:39.079
<v Christopher Swatty>capacity.</v>

00:24:40.209 --> 00:24:43.662
<v Christopher Swatty>Very important because it went systems
went down two years ago,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3236-1
00:24:43.662 --> 00:24:44.849
<v Christopher Swatty>I inherited something.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3256-0
00:24:44.849 --> 00:24:49.328
<v Christopher Swatty>I've been here just under two years and I
my team inherited a huge enterprise</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3256-1
00:24:49.328 --> 00:24:53.635
<v Christopher Swatty>application suite because they figured
out putting it in the cloud was too</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3256-2
00:24:53.635 --> 00:24:54.209
<v Christopher Swatty>expensive.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3261-0
00:24:55.839 --> 00:24:58.479
<v Christopher Swatty>And nobody owned it and #3.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3290-0
00:25:00.359 --> 00:25:05.429
<v Christopher Swatty>They had had an incident where they
needed to restore and the restore the the</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3290-1
00:25:05.429 --> 00:25:09.914
<v Christopher Swatty>actual backup was corrupt so they were
down and it was a production.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3285-0
00:25:08.659 --> 00:25:08.779
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

00:25:09.914 --> 00:25:11.279
<v Christopher Swatty>When you think about.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3310-0
00:25:11.589 --> 00:25:15.136
<v Christopher Swatty>David,
it's a production system that not only is</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3310-1
00:25:15.136 --> 00:25:18.829
<v Christopher Swatty>product creation and then all the
workflow, right.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3314-0
00:25:18.829 --> 00:25:21.109
<v Christopher Swatty>So, you know, ideation design.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3322-0
00:25:22.599 --> 00:25:24.319

<v Christopher Swatty>So it's the catalog too.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3373-0
00:25:35.189 --> 00:25:40.568
<v Christopher Swatty>It's it's product development, creation,
storage and then the catalog that's</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3373-1
00:25:40.568 --> 00:25:45.108
<v Christopher Swatty>offered up ultimately on the web.
So as a manufacturing company,</v>

00:25:52.719 --> 00:25:54.639
<v Christopher Swatty>Luckily, it wasn't.
During our peak season.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3392-0
00:25:54.639 --> 00:25:58.919
<v Christopher Swatty>Our peak season is like October one
through January.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3416-0
00:25:59.429 --> 00:26:03.837
<v Christopher Swatty>15 That's that's a no touch window for
anything because that's where that's</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3396-0

00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:08.928
<v Christopher Swatty>They're doing, you know,
a litany of things.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3430-0

00:26:08.928 --> 00:26:11.749
<v Christopher Swatty>But I think this this actually happened
in March.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3442-0
00:26:11.749 --> 00:26:12.549

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3455-0
00:26:14.079 --> 00:26:16.959
<v Christopher Swatty>The the impact was about a million to
five or it could have been.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3454-0
00:26:16.689 --> 00:26:16.889
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3461-0
00:26:18.109 --> 00:26:19.669
<v David Mondello>But much bigger.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3465-0
00:26:19.039 --> 00:26:21.199
<v Christopher Swatty>20304050 oh huge huge.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3468-0
00:26:21.259 --> 00:26:22.499

00:26:22.979 --> 00:26:24.539
<v David Mondello>So that's that's. That's a great, yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3471-0

<v David Mondello>Well,
thanks for for filling me in a little bit</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3514-1
00:26:27.144 --> 00:26:31.432
<v David Mondello>on on what you think would be what what
you might have been looking for as you</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3514-2
00:26:31.432 --> 00:26:35.883
<v David Mondello>were starting to come on to arc that you
didn't see initially and that would have</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3514-3
00:26:35.883 --> 00:26:37.729
<v David Mondello>been really helpful in in sort of.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3530-0
00:26:37.719 --> 00:26:41.739
<v David Mondello>Your assessment and also your use of of
the of the solution.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3547-0
00:26:41.739 --> 00:26:44.327
<v David Mondello>So with that,
I think I'm gonna transition out over to</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3547-1
00:26:44.327 --> 00:26:48.232
<v David Mondello>some of the concepts that we've prepared.
I wanna make sure we have enough time to</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3547-2
00:26:48.232 --> 00:26:49.079

00:26:49.229 --> 00:26:52.705
<v David Mondello>So the way to do that,
or the way I'm gonna do that is I'm gonna</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3552-0
00:26:49.439 --> 00:26:49.839

00:29:03.244 --> 00:29:05.079
<v David Mondello>starting to initially connect things to

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3944-0
00:29:05.079 --> 00:29:09.090
<v David Mondello>What are some of the questions that you

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3944-1
00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:12.359
<v David Mondello>that we're looking at now help anticipate
those or address those?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3952-0
00:29:11.949 --> 00:29:14.789
<v Christopher Swatty>So so from the interface perspective,

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3949-0
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:13.269

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3978-0
00:29:21.319 --> 00:29:24.319
<v Christopher Swatty>Eventually functionality, right? So I.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3994-0
00:29:24.209 --> 00:29:28.798
<v David Mondello>I think for for us right now,
what's actually most crucial is just the</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/3994-1
00:29:28.798 --> 00:29:31.449
<v David Mondello>the content like, does this help address?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4026-0
00:29:31.449 --> 00:29:34.083
<v David Mondello>I'm curious to hear some of those other

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4026-1
00:29:34.083 --> 00:29:38.035
<v David Mondello>but does this help in address some of the

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4026-2
00:29:38.035 --> 00:29:41.329
<v David Mondello>direct you or guide you in a way that's
that's intuitive for for you?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4039-0
00:29:41.539 --> 00:29:47.192
<v Christopher Swatty>It it does so the the thing that the
thing that stands out is this bit right</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4039-1
00:29:47.192 --> 00:29:47.559

00:29:51.159 --> 00:29:54.280
<v Christopher Swatty>Because when you look at managing the
environment,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4067-1
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.279

00:30:16.269 --> 00:30:16.469
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4106-0
00:30:16.619 --> 00:30:16.819
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4108-0
00:30:17.559 --> 00:30:20.679
<v Christopher Swatty>I like options, I really do.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4124-0
00:30:20.679 --> 00:30:24.426
<v Christopher Swatty>And I and it's really it's really
important that it doesn't just give you</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4114-0
00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:21.459
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4124-1
00:30:24.426 --> 00:30:25.439
<v Christopher Swatty>one solution, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4125-0
00:30:25.439 --> 00:30:26.199
<v Christopher Swatty>So here you go.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4145-0
00:30:26.239 --> 00:30:31.260
<v Christopher Swatty>Click here. Do this. Do that.
Do that this I like because I'm assuming</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4145-1
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:35.079
<v Christopher Swatty>without knowing right, David,
I haven't seen it, but.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4168-0
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:42.825
<v Christopher Swatty>It will allow me to bring resources on
board into the management console the way</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4168-1
00:30:42.825 --> 00:30:46.389
<v Christopher Swatty>I want to do it,
and I think hopefully it'll.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4180-0
00:30:46.819 --> 00:30:50.219
<v Christopher Swatty>It'll allow me to do it either like right
here in the machine.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4193-0
00:30:50.219 --> 00:30:55.706
<v Christopher Swatty>So onboarding option should give me an
option to onboard individual assets,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4193-1
00:30:55.706 --> 00:30:56.139
<v Christopher Swatty>right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4222-0
00:30:56.139 --> 00:31:02.084
<v Christopher Swatty>Or assets based on the operating system.
So Linux versus VMware Windows,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4199-0
00:30:56.459 --> 00:30:56.659
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4207-0
00:30:58.729 --> 00:30:58.849
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4222-1
00:31:02.084 --> 00:31:05.179
<v Christopher Swatty>you know 12 or 16 vers 25 or whatever.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4243-0
00:31:05.179 --> 00:31:10.121
<v Christopher Swatty>But then it should also allow me to
onboard the structure based on going back</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4243-1
00:31:10.121 --> 00:31:12.339
<v Christopher Swatty>to the geographic thing, right? So.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4242-0
00:31:12.219 --> 00:31:12.339
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4247-0
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.349
<v Christopher Swatty>Where are they located?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4253-0
00:31:15.109 --> 00:31:16.749
<v Christopher Swatty>So you know where in.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4266-0
00:31:17.779 --> 00:31:22.339
<v Christopher Swatty>Indiana, we're in Minnesota.
We're in Tempe, we're in Texas.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4277-0
00:31:22.339 --> 00:31:28.295
<v Christopher Swatty>We're in Haifa, Israel,
so being able to onboard it and then</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4277-1
00:31:28.295 --> 00:31:28.979
<v Christopher Swatty>assign.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4307-0
00:31:30.469 --> 00:31:34.405
<v Christopher Swatty>That asset to well,
hopefully it'll bring it up as as part of</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4307-1
00:31:34.405 --> 00:31:38.277
<v Christopher Swatty>location, I would hope,
but if it doesn't then being able to</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4295-0
00:31:35.559 --> 00:31:35.679
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4307-2
00:31:38.277 --> 00:31:40.309
<v Christopher Swatty>assign it and align it that way.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4322-0
00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:46.789
<v Christopher Swatty>But then maybe even be able to put it
into use groups, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4327-0
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:48.669
<v Christopher Swatty>So if if I were to onboard something.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4341-0
00:31:49.499 --> 00:31:52.699
<v Christopher Swatty>I'd like to know if it were an enterprise
application server.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4355-0
00:31:52.739 --> 00:31:57.379
<v Christopher Swatty>I'd like to know if it were and this is
individual, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4363-0
00:31:57.539 --> 00:31:59.579
<v Christopher Swatty>So I'd like to know what it does.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4356-0
00:31:57.589 --> 00:31:58.109
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4367-0
00:31:59.579 --> 00:32:01.739
<v Christopher Swatty>What's the function of that box is?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4369-0
00:32:01.349 --> 00:32:01.549
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4374-0
00:32:01.739 --> 00:32:03.259
<v Christopher Swatty>It is it managing?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4383-0
00:32:04.709 --> 00:32:05.989
<v Christopher Swatty>Is an Active Directory box.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4388-0
00:32:05.989 --> 00:32:06.989
<v Christopher Swatty>Is it managing andds?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4391-0
00:32:06.989 --> 00:32:08.469
<v Christopher Swatty>Is it managing print?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4394-0
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:11.029
<v Christopher Swatty>What's it doing?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4403-0
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:15.022
<v Christopher Swatty>Oh,
I don't know why my display thing just</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4403-1
00:32:15.022 --> 00:32:15.349
<v Christopher Swatty>dropped.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4405-0
00:32:15.349 --> 00:32:15.869
<v Christopher Swatty>I don't know why.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4413-0
00:32:17.239 --> 00:32:19.079
<v Christopher Swatty>Sorry about that, but.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4412-0
00:32:18.349 --> 00:32:18.989
<v David Mondello>That's OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4420-0
00:32:20.629 --> 00:32:22.309
<v Christopher Swatty>So yeah, it's it's having.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4425-0
00:32:22.509 --> 00:32:24.269
<v Christopher Swatty>It's a. It's an HP.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4429-0
00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:25.229
<v Christopher Swatty>It's a new HP laptop.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4455-0
00:32:26.989 --> 00:32:29.684
<v Christopher Swatty>It's getting kinda funky,
which is not surprising me at all,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4441-0
00:32:28.449 --> 00:32:28.849
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4455-1
00:32:29.684 --> 00:32:31.629
<v Christopher Swatty>but I'm still looking at the screen,
right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4450-0
00:32:30.469 --> 00:32:30.629
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4495-0
00:32:31.629 --> 00:32:36.349
<v Christopher Swatty>So bringing on individual assets,
being able to associate them in not</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4458-0
00:32:32.829 --> 00:32:32.989
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4495-1
00:32:36.349 --> 00:32:40.462
<v Christopher Swatty>knowing how deep of a dive it does from
an SNMP perspective,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4483-0
00:32:38.799 --> 00:32:39.279
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4495-2
00:32:40.462 --> 00:32:43.631
<v Christopher Swatty>being able to associate those by
applications.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4495-3
00:32:43.631 --> 00:32:45.789
<v Christopher Swatty>So if I can slice and dice here.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4492-0
00:32:43.649 --> 00:32:44.129
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4498-0
00:32:46.059 --> 00:32:47.899
<v Christopher Swatty>Are you know there's 20 servers?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4509-0
00:32:49.709 --> 00:32:51.709
<v Christopher Swatty>Five of each may be doing different
things.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4560-0
00:32:51.709 --> 00:32:56.205
<v Christopher Swatty>You know that one group may be the
utility boxes. Like I said,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4511-0
00:32:52.169 --> 00:32:52.369
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4560-1
00:32:56.205 --> 00:33:00.415
<v Christopher Swatty>NDS or or not NDS,
but Active Directory or print server or</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4523-0
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.589
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4560-2
00:33:00.415 --> 00:33:05.125
<v Christopher Swatty>or DHCP or those things utility.
What I consider utility servers,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4540-0
00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:02.599
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4560-3
00:33:05.125 --> 00:33:10.549
<v Christopher Swatty>another group maybe database servers.
So they may be part of the Oracle Su.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4555-0
00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:09.019
<v David Mondello>Great.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4571-0
00:33:10.949 --> 00:33:13.669
<v Christopher Swatty>Right or or all SQL servers and then?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4565-0
00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:11.439
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4574-0
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:15.189
<v Christopher Swatty>Something else maybe?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4589-0
00:33:16.179 --> 00:33:21.219
<v Christopher Swatty>In the Informatica or the SAP world.
So being able to.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4583-0
00:33:18.139 --> 00:33:18.339
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4641-0
00:33:22.749 --> 00:33:27.715
<v Christopher Swatty>I think slice dice and and build pools
such that it it goes,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4641-1
00:33:27.715 --> 00:33:31.703
<v Christopher Swatty>it goes back to the performance thing too
right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4603-0
00:33:29.019 --> 00:33:29.299
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4641-2
00:33:31.703 --> 00:33:37.809
<v Christopher Swatty>Because like a A DHCP box on a print
server those are they should never be</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4613-0
00:33:31.719 --> 00:33:32.279
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4641-3
00:33:37.809 --> 00:33:42.286
<v Christopher Swatty>bouncing off.
You know 80% utility application servers</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4637-0
00:33:41.409 --> 00:33:41.609
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4641-4
00:33:42.286 --> 00:33:43.589
<v Christopher Swatty>relative to how.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4647-0
00:33:43.589 --> 00:33:45.069
<v Christopher Swatty>Many departments have access to it.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4664-0
00:33:45.339 --> 00:33:50.699
<v Christopher Swatty>Like for financial application or
especially like Oracle rack nodes.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4652-0
00:33:46.159 --> 00:33:46.639
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4663-0
00:33:51.099 --> 00:33:51.299
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4681-0
00:33:52.229 --> 00:33:58.323
<v Christopher Swatty>Very important that we track and trend
the performance of those because they can</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4681-1
00:33:58.323 --> 00:33:58.549
<v Christopher Swatty>be.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4684-0
00:34:02.609 --> 00:34:03.449
<v Christopher Swatty>Highly.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4693-0
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:07.549
<v Christopher Swatty>Transactional right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4707-0
00:34:07.589 --> 00:34:10.149
<v Christopher Swatty>So there's a lot of compute,
a lot of data.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4695-0
00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:08.079
<v David Mondello>That's good.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4709-0
00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:11.239
<v David Mondello>Yeah. So I think that that's great.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4745-0
00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:15.416
<v David Mondello>I think that that's really it and it's a
really it's helpful for me to understand</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4745-1
00:34:15.416 --> 00:34:19.236
<v David Mondello>kind of what you're expecting to see
behind some of the compare onboarding</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4745-2
00:34:19.236 --> 00:34:22.802
<v David Mondello>options and and what would be
specifically useful for for you in, in,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4745-3
00:34:22.802 --> 00:34:24.789
<v David Mondello>in your your setup. I'm kind of wonder.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4764-0
00:34:24.799 --> 00:34:27.520
<v David Mondello>Also,
what else on this page besides the</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4764-1
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.639
<v David Mondello>comparing onboarding options catches your
eye?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4773-0
00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:34.309
<v David Mondello>And and how you kind of understand some
of the other information on this page?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4783-0
00:34:34.779 --> 00:34:36.179
<v Christopher Swatty>So going back right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4781-0
00:34:36.119 --> 00:34:36.319
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4785-0
00:34:36.619 --> 00:34:38.299
<v Christopher Swatty>Monitoring for me is.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4789-0
00:34:39.579 --> 00:34:40.219
<v Christopher Swatty>Very important.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4792-0
00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:40.749
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4795-0
00:34:40.539 --> 00:34:41.379
<v Christopher Swatty>Highly important.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4810-0
00:34:41.939 --> 00:34:45.724
<v Christopher Swatty>I want to know what's going on where and
it and it sort of touches on the what's</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4810-1
00:34:45.724 --> 00:34:46.379
<v Christopher Swatty>running where.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4813-0
00:34:46.539 --> 00:34:46.939
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4817-0
00:34:47.419 --> 00:34:48.699
<v Christopher Swatty>But what's running where?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4821-0
00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:49.819
<v Christopher Swatty>And then what is that?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4844-0
00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:56.931
<v Christopher Swatty>What does the health of that system look
like? And and that would be in terms of,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4844-1
00:34:56.931 --> 00:34:58.819
<v Christopher Swatty>you know, IO and storage?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4851-0
00:34:59.219 --> 00:35:02.579
<v Christopher Swatty>So hopefully we're not bouncing off of
high IO.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4841-0
00:34:59.279 --> 00:34:59.719
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4871-0
00:35:05.029 --> 00:35:08.675
<v Christopher Swatty>You know,
meaning that we may have provisioned it</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4871-1
00:35:08.675 --> 00:35:13.269
<v Christopher Swatty>with too few cores or not enough storage
in terms of the Luns.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4874-0
00:35:13.769 --> 00:35:13.889
<v David Mondello>Mm H.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4885-0
00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:18.189
<v Christopher Swatty>We wanna be able to watch that because
I've got a lot of internal customers.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4883-0
00:35:16.959 --> 00:35:17.159
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4901-0
00:35:18.979 --> 00:35:22.459
<v Christopher Swatty>I mean basically I'm in customer service.
That's it.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4893-0
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.349
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4899-0
00:35:21.429 --> 00:35:21.589
<v David Mondello>I see.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4926-0
00:35:22.619 --> 00:35:26.760
<v Christopher Swatty>I you know, I work for the company,
but more on customer service and there's</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4926-1
00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.579
<v Christopher Swatty>pods of people out there that we serve
relative to their applications.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4929-0
00:35:30.559 --> 00:35:30.999
<v David Mondello>I see.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4931-0
00:35:31.989 --> 00:35:32.949
<v Christopher Swatty>So that's really, really important.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4939-0
00:35:34.709 --> 00:35:35.829
<v Christopher Swatty>Licensing is huge.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4944-0
00:35:36.229 --> 00:35:38.429
<v Christopher Swatty>Licensing is huge because one thing that.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4941-0
00:35:36.539 --> 00:35:36.739
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4959-0
00:35:40.379 --> 00:35:43.777
<v Christopher Swatty>Not every company does well,
I don't think we're different than a lot</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4956-0
00:35:42.999 --> 00:35:43.199
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4959-1
00:35:43.777 --> 00:35:44.699
<v Christopher Swatty>of other companies.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4968-0
00:35:45.259 --> 00:35:47.699
<v Christopher Swatty>I don't think we do well in managing
licenses.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4970-0
00:35:48.289 --> 00:35:48.369
<v David Mondello>Mm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4977-0
00:35:48.339 --> 00:35:51.299
<v Christopher Swatty>I think that because there's an inherent
cost to that, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4980-0
00:35:51.709 --> 00:35:52.109
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/4991-0
00:35:52.789 --> 00:35:56.069
<v Christopher Swatty>And and each company has its own approach
towards licensing.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5004-0
00:35:56.069 --> 00:36:02.629
<v Christopher Swatty>So Broadcom licenses by the core Oracle
licensed by the the database instance.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5006-0
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:05.189
<v Christopher Swatty>And.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5009-0
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.949
<v Christopher Swatty>The.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5011-0
00:36:08.749 --> 00:36:08.989
<v Christopher Swatty>Hitachi.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5024-0
00:36:09.339 --> 00:36:12.218
<v Christopher Swatty>And some of the other hardware things
that I've got,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5024-1
00:36:12.218 --> 00:36:13.739
<v Christopher Swatty>they licensed by the device.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5053-0
00:36:15.229 --> 00:36:18.486
<v Christopher Swatty>And that's why understanding not a rabbit
hole,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5053-1
00:36:18.486 --> 00:36:23.779
<v Christopher Swatty>but understanding the the health and the
performance of their device helps us</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5053-2
00:36:23.779 --> 00:36:26.629
<v Christopher Swatty>determine how many devices we have, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5064-0
00:36:26.669 --> 00:36:30.709
<v Christopher Swatty>Are we over provision like in a Veritas
perspective?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5056-0
00:36:26.809 --> 00:36:27.449
<v David Mondello>Yeah, right.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5062-0
00:36:30.659 --> 00:36:30.859
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5076-0
00:36:30.869 --> 00:36:33.749
<v Christopher Swatty>Just an example. We've got a number.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5104-0
00:36:32.719 --> 00:36:37.225
<v David Mondello>It sounds like licensing and and health
are are two areas that are important for</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5089-0
00:36:36.519 --> 00:36:37.239
<v Christopher Swatty>They are.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5104-1
00:36:37.225 --> 00:36:40.562
<v David Mondello>you in this list,
so taking a look at the the content on on</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5094-0
00:36:37.799 --> 00:36:38.399
<v Christopher Swatty>They are.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5104-2
00:36:40.562 --> 00:36:41.119
<v David Mondello>this page.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5142-0
00:36:41.119 --> 00:36:43.631
<v David Mondello>So we looked at the stuff above and the
stuff below,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5142-1
00:36:43.631 --> 00:36:47.471
<v David Mondello>and I'm wondering if you could tell me a
little bit about how you understand the</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5142-2
00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:51.264
<v David Mondello>relationship between those items and and
how you understand sort of the flow of</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5142-3
00:36:51.264 --> 00:36:52.639
<v David Mondello>the information on this page.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5152-0
00:36:53.639 --> 00:36:57.345
<v Christopher Swatty>Well,
it all comes down to the asset itself,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5152-1
00:36:57.345 --> 00:36:57.839
<v Christopher Swatty>right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5170-0
00:36:57.879 --> 00:37:02.599
<v Christopher Swatty>So the the components,
the the capabilities right there, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5165-0
00:37:02.339 --> 00:37:03.219
<v David Mondello>OK. Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5180-0
00:37:02.839 --> 00:37:07.799
<v Christopher Swatty>So secure resources I don't understand
the concept the the context right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5181-0
00:37:07.399 --> 00:37:08.279
<v David Mondello>OK, OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5183-0
00:37:08.199 --> 00:37:09.239
<v Christopher Swatty>Because I do.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5189-0
00:37:09.239 --> 00:37:11.599
<v Christopher Swatty>Because when you say secure,
it means a lot of things.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5191-0
00:37:11.959 --> 00:37:12.479
<v David Mondello>Right.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5216-0
00:37:13.429 --> 00:37:18.485
<v Christopher Swatty>But monitoring health and
containerization of the workloads this is</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5216-1
00:37:18.485 --> 00:37:23.616
<v Christopher Swatty>all about resource management,
allocation and and then to the bit of</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5210-0

00:37:25.579 --> 00:37:29.422
<v Christopher Swatty>So when you put when you deploy,
you know the Kubernetes or the the</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5243-1
00:37:29.422 --> 00:37:30.779
<v Christopher Swatty>containerized workloads.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5263-0
00:37:31.139 --> 00:37:36.008
<v Christopher Swatty>That is really important for you to track
to make sure that they're actually</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5263-1
00:37:36.008 --> 00:37:39.739
<v Christopher Swatty>functioning properly and you're not over,
you're not over.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5271-0
00:37:39.979 --> 00:37:41.539
<v Christopher Swatty>And again,
it goes back to provisioning too.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5289-0
00:37:41.539 --> 00:37:45.353
<v Christopher Swatty>You're not over provision in terms of
that and people aren't utilizing them as</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5289-1
00:37:45.353 --> 00:37:48.299
<v Christopher Swatty>much as you're licensed for and it goes
back to license, so.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5299-0
00:37:49.949 --> 00:37:53.949
<v Christopher Swatty>Managing the health,

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5338-0
00:37:54.299 --> 00:38:01.357
<v Christopher Swatty>And then rightsizing things to make sure
are we doing just what we need ±2% or 5%,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5302-0
00:37:54.559 --> 00:37:54.759
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5314-0

<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5338-1
00:38:01.357 --> 00:38:05.099
<v Christopher Swatty>not ±30%,
which is what I inherited or 50%?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5357-0
00:38:02.779 --> 00:38:08.181

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5361-0
00:38:06.789 --> 00:38:10.669
<v Christopher Swatty>So the the relationship is good.
That's what you asked about.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5357-1
00:38:08.181 --> 00:38:09.019
<v David Mondello>specific.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5358-0
00:38:09.299 --> 00:38:10.459

00:38:10.939 --> 00:38:14.178
<v David Mondello>The relationship is good and so the
relationship not only on on this</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5396-1
00:38:14.178 --> 00:38:16.526
<v David Mondello>component,
but we also took a look at the the the</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5396-2
00:38:16.526 --> 00:38:19.953
<v David Mondello>piece above around you know the the
comparing onboarding options and I'm</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5396-3
00:38:19.953 --> 00:38:23.333
<v David Mondello>wondering what you see is the
relationship between the the first set of</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5396-4
00:38:23.333 --> 00:38:23.709
<v David Mondello>options.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5410-0
00:38:23.709 --> 00:38:26.859
<v David Mondello>You see here on the page and then that
content that you're just reviewing down</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5410-1
00:38:26.859 --> 00:38:27.099
<v David Mondello>below.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5422-0
00:38:28.149 --> 00:38:30.549
<v David Mondello>Yeah. Any any sort of relation to receive?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5426-0
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:32.389
<v Christopher Swatty>On what can I dig into it?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5442-0
00:38:33.199 --> 00:38:36.601
<v David Mondello>Yeah. I think for for time,
let's let's go ahead and and and dig into</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5442-1
00:38:36.601 --> 00:38:37.039
<v David Mondello>it, yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5444-0
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.669
<v Christopher Swatty>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5446-0
00:38:39.309 --> 00:38:39.389
<v Christopher Swatty>So.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5449-0
00:38:45.139 --> 00:38:45.779
<v Christopher Swatty>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5457-0
00:38:47.269 --> 00:38:48.269
<v Christopher Swatty>Alright, here's your input.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5470-0
00:38:48.789 --> 00:38:55.989
<v Christopher Swatty>So the machines onboard single machine or
multiple with service principal right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5485-0
00:38:56.029 --> 00:38:59.599
<v Christopher Swatty>So a service principal to me would be the
relationship between the machines and</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5485-1
00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:01.429
<v Christopher Swatty>that's what we were talking about before.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5495-0
00:39:01.429 --> 00:39:05.949
<v Christopher Swatty>So actually building a relational
connection between machines, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5509-0
00:39:05.989 --> 00:39:09.169
<v Christopher Swatty>Like I said,
application servers or utility boxes or</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5498-0
00:39:06.359 --> 00:39:06.479
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5509-1
00:39:09.169 --> 00:39:09.709
<v Christopher Swatty>whatever.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5517-0
00:39:09.749 --> 00:39:13.389
<v Christopher Swatty>Or is it a finance you know?
Is it a pool of finance?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5520-0
00:39:14.389 --> 00:39:14.629
<v Christopher Swatty>Applications.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5531-0
00:39:15.059 --> 00:39:17.579
<v Christopher Swatty>And servers.
Is it a pool of manufacturing?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5535-0
00:39:17.579 --> 00:39:18.979
<v Christopher Swatty>Is it a pool of HR?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5538-0
00:39:19.019 --> 00:39:19.779
<v Christopher Swatty>Is it a pool of?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5548-0
00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:24.749
<v Christopher Swatty>So being able to build the relationships
which.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5592-0
00:39:26.389 --> 00:39:30.261
<v Christopher Swatty>The the service principal and also and
also the support component of it too,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5556-0
00:39:27.979 --> 00:39:28.179
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5592-1
00:39:30.261 --> 00:39:34.537
<v Christopher Swatty>because when you build something it's not.
You're not just building a static device,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5592-2
00:39:34.537 --> 00:39:38.309
<v Christopher Swatty>you're building something that requires
patching. It requires maintenance.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5589-0
00:39:37.549 --> 00:39:37.949
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5608-0
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:43.779
<v Christopher Swatty>All my 400 Dell boxes are either under
warranty with Dell or warranty from an</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5608-1
00:39:43.779 --> 00:39:45.509
<v Christopher Swatty>extended service provider.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5618-0
00:39:46.279 --> 00:39:49.039
<v Christopher Swatty>So the service principal to me would be
all right.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5621-0
00:39:49.039 --> 00:39:50.399
<v Christopher Swatty>Well, how often you patch it?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5632-0
00:39:52.029 --> 00:39:55.349
<v Christopher Swatty>What do you how do you handle tickets if
something goes wrong with it, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5631-0
00:39:55.889 --> 00:39:56.089

<v Christopher Swatty>I like the options of of single versus
multiple, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5839-0
00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:59.434
<v Christopher Swatty>So multiple machines with the same with
the same shared component and it it</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5817-0
00:40:54.989 --> 00:40:55.309
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5839-1
00:40:59.434 --> 00:41:01.499
<v Christopher Swatty>mentioned service principal right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5833-0
00:40:59.859 --> 00:41:00.059
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5850-0
00:41:01.699 --> 00:41:06.059
<v Christopher Swatty>But to me it would be application family
or.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5841-0
00:41:01.739 --> 00:41:01.939
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5849-0
00:41:06.279 --> 00:41:06.399
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5877-0
00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:13.864
<v Christopher Swatty>Something that would relate them besides
your service right services component of</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5864-0
00:41:12.289 --> 00:41:12.569
<v David Mondello>I see.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5877-1
00:41:13.864 --> 00:41:17.597
<v Christopher Swatty>what we do,
but to me understand the environment and</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5877-2
00:41:17.597 --> 00:41:19.569
<v Christopher Swatty>building them going back to.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5881-0
00:41:19.959 --> 00:41:20.839
<v Christopher Swatty>If you think about it.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5890-0
00:41:22.449 --> 00:41:24.369
<v Christopher Swatty>A map you know geographically,
what does it look like?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5902-0
00:41:24.369 --> 00:41:28.169
<v Christopher Swatty>Can I build it in that view like you can
with Active Directory, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5915-0
00:41:28.169 --> 00:41:32.649
<v Christopher Swatty>You can see you can see containers OS O
us you can see the whole tree.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5919-0
00:41:32.499 --> 00:41:32.859
<v David Mondello>Yep.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5922-0
00:41:32.649 --> 00:41:34.769
<v Christopher Swatty>You can see the way it's laid out
basically, but.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5948-0
00:41:36.449 --> 00:41:41.149
<v Christopher Swatty>Clustering the the server or the
instances the environments,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5936-0
00:41:40.859 --> 00:41:41.259
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5948-1
00:41:41.149 --> 00:41:46.929
<v Christopher Swatty>whatever you wanna call it in logical
ways would be tremendously valuable.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5945-0
00:41:45.369 --> 00:41:45.569
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5960-0
00:41:47.359 --> 00:41:50.719
<v Christopher Swatty>And how you do that? How you do that?
There's like I said, a lot of options.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5954-0
00:41:47.439 --> 00:41:47.799
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5973-0
00:41:50.719 --> 00:41:53.199
<v Christopher Swatty>You can go by department.
You go by application type.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5968-0
00:41:51.189 --> 00:41:51.589
<v David Mondello>Sure.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5996-0
00:41:53.199 --> 00:41:58.228
<v Christopher Swatty>You can go by the the amount of user base
right is an enterprise application like</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5985-0
00:41:56.469 --> 00:41:57.069
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5996-1
00:41:58.228 --> 00:42:01.479
<v Christopher Swatty>like exchanges.
Or is it a departmental application?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/5993-0
00:41:59.669 --> 00:41:59.869
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6011-0
00:42:03.009 --> 00:42:07.729
<v Christopher Swatty>And then obviously physical location and
then the health or?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6007-0
00:42:05.799 --> 00:42:05.999
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6020-0
00:42:09.369 --> 00:42:11.289
<v Christopher Swatty>Gee,
there's a whole bunch of different stuff.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6022-0
00:42:10.799 --> 00:42:12.239
<v David Mondello>Sure. Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6063-0
00:42:12.439 --> 00:42:16.363
<v David Mondello>And when you take a look at the the
content on the right side of the of the</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6063-1
00:42:16.363 --> 00:42:18.997
<v David Mondello>page here,
like initial onboarding time and common</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6063-2
00:42:18.997 --> 00:42:21.734
<v David Mondello>prerequisites,
I'm kinda interested to hear from you</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6063-3
00:42:21.734 --> 00:42:25.969
<v David Mondello>what you make of the content that's there.
If it's valuable at the stage or what.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6067-0
00:42:25.969 --> 00:42:27.159
<v David Mondello>Else you might be looking for.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6085-0
00:42:27.249 --> 00:42:32.769
<v Christopher Swatty>So what I like just first blush is the
onboarding time.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6109-0
00:42:32.809 --> 00:42:36.652
<v Christopher Swatty>So setting expectations is really,
really important because you don't know</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6083-0
00:42:33.149 --> 00:42:33.429
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6093-0
00:42:36.629 --> 00:42:36.829
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6109-1
00:42:36.652 --> 00:42:40.341
<v Christopher Swatty>if it's performing well or not,
unless you have some sort of framework,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6109-2
00:42:40.341 --> 00:42:40.649
<v Christopher Swatty>right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6156-0
00:42:40.649 --> 00:42:44.372
<v Christopher Swatty>So when it says 5 to 15 minutes depending
on network speed,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6112-0
00:42:40.699 --> 00:42:40.899
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6121-0
00:42:43.819 --> 00:42:43.939
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6156-1
00:42:44.372 --> 00:42:49.585
<v Christopher Swatty>it it sets an expectation right away that
if if we go if if it takes longer than 15</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6156-2
00:42:49.585 --> 00:42:53.929
<v Christopher Swatty>minutes to build that asset or asset pool
or whatever, it looks like,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6156-3
00:42:53.929 --> 00:42:55.729
<v Christopher Swatty>then there's something wrong.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6185-0
00:42:56.119 --> 00:43:00.019
<v Christopher Swatty>Right.
It may speak to our network latency or it</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6159-0
00:42:56.339 --> 00:42:56.459
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6185-1
00:43:00.019 --> 00:43:04.159
<v Christopher Swatty>may speak to the geographic locations of
that pool.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6186-0
00:43:04.159 --> 00:43:05.319
<v Christopher Swatty>So I could have.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6200-0
00:43:05.639 --> 00:43:08.248
<v Christopher Swatty>And again,
I go back to polling because I like</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6200-1
00:43:08.248 --> 00:43:09.359
<v Christopher Swatty>categorizing things.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6210-0
00:43:09.359 --> 00:43:14.319
<v Christopher Swatty>It helps in so many in so many ways,
but I can have an application.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6198-0
00:43:09.649 --> 00:43:10.009
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6230-0
00:43:15.849 --> 00:43:21.903
<v Christopher Swatty>It could have a finance application,
whatever HR application we got, you know,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6230-1
00:43:21.903 --> 00:43:24.049
<v Christopher Swatty>couple servers in Muncie IN.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6243-0
00:43:24.359 --> 00:43:26.479
<v Christopher Swatty>We've got a couple servers in San
Francisco.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6253-0
00:43:26.479 --> 00:43:28.559
<v Christopher Swatty>We got a couple servers in Plano, TX.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6249-0
00:43:27.539 --> 00:43:27.739
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6257-0
00:43:28.559 --> 00:43:30.679
<v Christopher Swatty>We got a couple here so.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6259-0
00:43:32.729 --> 00:43:32.889
<v Christopher Swatty>When?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6304-0
00:43:33.479 --> 00:43:37.024
<v Christopher Swatty>When you try to bring those on, well,
one onboarding from an individual</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6272-0
00:43:35.319 --> 00:43:35.519
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6304-1
00:43:37.024 --> 00:43:40.915
<v Christopher Swatty>perspective or onboarding, like I said,
in a pool which would be a tremendous,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6288-0
00:43:40.259 --> 00:43:40.539
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6304-2
00:43:40.915 --> 00:43:43.919
<v Christopher Swatty>which would be a great way to do it,
there'd be a lot of it.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6305-0
00:43:43.389 --> 00:43:43.749
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6354-0
00:43:43.959 --> 00:43:48.964
<v Christopher Swatty>It'd be hard to do from a from a database
perspective for your application. OK,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6324-0
00:43:48.929 --> 00:43:49.129
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6354-1
00:43:48.964 --> 00:43:52.530
<v Christopher Swatty>it'd be tough,
but if you had options to be able to pull</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6354-2
00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:56.659
<v Christopher Swatty>so as you build individuals,
so say I build 20 individual servers</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6354-3
00:43:56.659 --> 00:43:58.599
<v Christopher Swatty>right onboard a single machine.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6352-0
00:43:57.019 --> 00:43:57.539
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6358-0
00:43:59.209 --> 00:43:59.369
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6365-0
00:43:59.409 --> 00:44:02.769
<v Christopher Swatty>So I onboard 20 servers then in
management.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6387-0
00:44:03.439 --> 00:44:11.811
<v Christopher Swatty>Whether it's a view or whether it's a way
to manage patching or the scripting bits</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6386-0
00:44:11.809 --> 00:44:12.009
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6387-1
00:44:11.811 --> 00:44:12.719
<v Christopher Swatty>right so.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6415-0
00:44:14.209 --> 00:44:18.334
<v Christopher Swatty>Once I build those 20 assets,
it'd be great to pull those based on.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6415-1
00:44:18.334 --> 00:44:21.489
<v Christopher Swatty>Like I said,
application owner geographic location.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6411-0
00:44:19.029 --> 00:44:19.389
<v David Mondello>Yep.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6419-0
00:44:23.369 --> 00:44:24.929
<v Christopher Swatty>Even machine type.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6427-0
00:44:27.209 --> 00:44:27.929
<v Christopher Swatty>There'd be a lot.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6434-0
00:44:27.929 --> 00:44:29.169
<v Christopher Swatty>And like I said, it'd be difficult.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6431-0
00:44:28.639 --> 00:44:29.159
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6439-0
00:44:29.209 --> 00:44:32.289
<v Christopher Swatty>It'd be difficult to build something that
everybody would love.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6452-0
00:44:32.679 --> 00:44:36.119
<v Christopher Swatty>Of but having options to to cluster those
after that.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6445-0
00:44:33.169 --> 00:44:33.369
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6454-0
00:44:36.479 --> 00:44:36.679
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6465-0
00:44:37.649 --> 00:44:39.809
<v Christopher Swatty>But going back initial onboarding time,
that's great.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6496-0
00:44:39.889 --> 00:44:43.594
<v Christopher Swatty>I know to expect minimum 5 minutes Max 15
minutes if it's beyond that there's</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6467-0
00:44:40.139 --> 00:44:40.539
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6477-0
00:44:42.929 --> 00:44:43.129
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6496-1
00:44:43.594 --> 00:44:46.396
<v Christopher Swatty>something wrong,
I might have to restart or you might have</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6496-2
00:44:46.396 --> 00:44:47.489
<v Christopher Swatty>to look at the network.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6498-0
00:44:48.079 --> 00:44:48.439
<v David Mondello>Yep.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6517-0
00:44:49.209 --> 00:44:53.912
<v Christopher Swatty>The the common prerequisites.
Obviously you're telling me I've got to</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6517-1
00:44:53.912 --> 00:44:56.129
<v Christopher Swatty>have administrator rights, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6521-0
00:44:56.049 --> 00:44:56.449
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6527-0
00:44:56.129 --> 00:44:59.929
<v Christopher Swatty>At least on the on the local machine.
So if I try to build these.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6530-0
00:45:01.569 --> 00:45:02.209
<v Christopher Swatty>It's going to fail.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6544-0
00:45:02.519 --> 00:45:06.599
<v Christopher Swatty>I'll unless my credentials have the
proper level of access.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6550-0
00:45:06.919 --> 00:45:09.759
<v Christopher Swatty>So you're again,
you're setting expectation.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6543-0
00:45:06.939 --> 00:45:07.139
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6552-0
00:45:09.799 --> 00:45:10.679
<v Christopher Swatty>I think it's a good thing.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6556-0
00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:11.319
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6557-0
00:45:11.209 --> 00:45:11.809
<v Christopher Swatty>Because.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6600-0
00:45:13.329 --> 00:45:16.972
<v Christopher Swatty>It's like, look, if you don't,
if you're not local admin or if like if</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6571-0
00:45:16.459 --> 00:45:16.979
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6600-1
00:45:16.972 --> 00:45:19.640
<v Christopher Swatty>it's a service account that I'm trying to
leverage,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6600-2
00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.130
<v Christopher Swatty>if it doesn't have the proper
administrative rights to run scripts,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6585-0
00:45:19.889 --> 00:45:20.089
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6600-3
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:26.055
<v Christopher Swatty>then guess what,
you're not gonna be able to onboard it,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6599-0
00:45:25.279 --> 00:45:25.479
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6600-4
00:45:26.055 --> 00:45:26.209
<v Christopher Swatty>so.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6621-0
00:45:27.929 --> 00:45:32.400
<v Christopher Swatty>It it just it helps because basically if
it breaks I look at that and say, OK,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6613-0
00:45:29.739 --> 00:45:30.099
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6621-1
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.929
<v Christopher Swatty>well, This is why you know.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6629-0
00:45:36.009 --> 00:45:38.929
<v Christopher Swatty>And then supported operating systems?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6634-0
00:45:38.929 --> 00:45:40.729
<v Christopher Swatty>I don't if any of this is interactive.
It's not.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6650-0
00:45:40.879 --> 00:45:44.239
<v Christopher Swatty>Not it's just a it's picture, OK, so.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6657-0
00:45:42.679 --> 00:45:46.999
<v David Mondello>Yeah. So, yeah, I think, yeah,
if there's other prerequisites.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6696-0
00:45:46.999 --> 00:45:50.852
<v David Mondello>So it sounds like some of the information
that's listed here and again it sounds</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6696-1
00:45:50.852 --> 00:45:53.326
<v David Mondello>like on the monitoring side of the
management side,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6696-2
00:45:53.326 --> 00:45:55.562
<v David Mondello>this this concept of grouping is is
important,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6696-3
00:45:55.562 --> 00:45:58.844
<v David Mondello>but on the actual connection side,
which is kind of what we're we're</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6696-4
00:45:58.844 --> 00:46:00.129
<v David Mondello>focusing on for these scre.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6701-0
00:45:59.569 --> 00:46:00.809
<v Christopher Swatty>Uh, huh. Sure.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6721-0
00:46:00.999 --> 00:46:04.848
<v David Mondello>Is there any sort of additional
information on prerequisites or that</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6721-1
00:46:04.848 --> 00:46:07.359
<v David Mondello>you'd like to see here to better
understand?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6728-0
00:46:07.399 --> 00:46:08.719
<v Christopher Swatty>You know what instead?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6725-0
00:46:08.049 --> 00:46:08.369
<v David Mondello>The options.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6732-0
00:46:08.369 --> 00:46:08.689
<v David Mondello>You're choosing among.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6767-0
00:46:09.479 --> 00:46:13.319
<v Christopher Swatty>Instead of a,
learn more under supported operating</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6745-0
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.549
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6767-1
00:46:13.319 --> 00:46:16.933
<v Christopher Swatty>systems.
I'd like to see a list of EM and so if</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6767-2
00:46:16.933 --> 00:46:20.999
<v Christopher Swatty>you had REL,
you know this'll run on REL 6 through 9.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6777-0
00:46:21.039 --> 00:46:25.079
<v Christopher Swatty>This'll run on Windows, you know,
2010 through 25.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6769-0
00:46:21.489 --> 00:46:21.689
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6779-0
00:46:25.299 --> 00:46:25.499
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6795-0
00:46:26.569 --> 00:46:30.249
<v Christopher Swatty>Or it will run on these and it won't run
on these, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6793-0
00:46:30.199 --> 00:46:30.519
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6813-0
00:46:30.649 --> 00:46:35.905
<v Christopher Swatty>So that provides a minimum build
requirement for me to understand to get</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6813-1
00:46:35.905 --> 00:46:38.929
<v Christopher Swatty>it in there because compatibility is huge.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6821-0
00:46:38.999 --> 00:46:40.479
<v Christopher Swatty>Huge in what we do, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6824-0
00:46:39.599 --> 00:46:40.919
<v David Mondello>Yeah, right.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6845-0
00:46:40.479 --> 00:46:45.436
<v Christopher Swatty>So backups my backup systems.
Some of our instances that are still</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6845-1
00:46:45.436 --> 00:46:48.839
<v Christopher Swatty>being run by some of our Subs,
our companies.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6844-0
00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:49.339
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6892-0
00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:53.214
<v Christopher Swatty>They are beyond end of life and support
life,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6858-0
00:46:52.909 --> 00:46:53.429
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6892-1
00:46:53.214 --> 00:46:57.066
<v Christopher Swatty>so we can't back up and and if we want to
migrate to a new system,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6892-2
00:46:57.066 --> 00:47:00.631
<v Christopher Swatty>they've got to uplift them.
They've got to upgrade to a newer</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6881-0
00:46:59.579 --> 00:47:00.019
<v David Mondello>Yep.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6892-3
00:47:00.631 --> 00:47:01.609
<v Christopher Swatty>operating system.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6907-0
00:47:01.609 --> 00:47:05.682
<v Christopher Swatty>So having a list of what what this will
run on and what it won't,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6891-0
00:47:02.269 --> 00:47:02.469
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6907-1
00:47:05.682 --> 00:47:08.089
<v Christopher Swatty>or at least inferring what it won't so.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6902-0
00:47:05.889 --> 00:47:06.089
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6913-0
00:47:08.579 --> 00:47:08.899
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6914-0
00:47:08.639 --> 00:47:10.359
<v Christopher Swatty>Windows 2012 and beyond.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6917-0
00:47:10.489 --> 00:47:10.689
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6925-0
00:47:11.849 --> 00:47:13.049
<v Christopher Swatty>You know, relate and above.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6927-0
00:47:12.969 --> 00:47:13.969
<v David Mondello>Yeah, I see.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6929-0
00:47:14.889 --> 00:47:15.049
<v Christopher Swatty>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6931-0
00:47:15.409 --> 00:47:15.889
<v David Mondello>That's great.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6934-0
00:47:15.929 --> 00:47:16.449
<v David Mondello>That's great.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6943-0
00:47:16.449 --> 00:47:19.209
<v David Mondello>I think the last thing before we leave
this page and go to the the last one.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6959-0
00:47:20.929 --> 00:47:24.067
<v David Mondello>On the left side,
currently we're looking at the options</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6959-1
00:47:24.067 --> 00:47:25.169
<v David Mondello>for any environment.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6989-0
00:47:25.169 --> 00:47:29.944
<v David Mondello>There's some other options there,
and I'm wondering if there's anything</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6974-0
00:47:28.779 --> 00:47:29.939
<v Christopher Swatty>Location management.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6989-1
00:47:29.944 --> 00:47:34.189
<v David Mondello>that you so like a multi cloud host
environment, Edge hardware,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6989-2
00:47:34.189 --> 00:47:35.449
<v David Mondello>Internet of Things.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/6997-0
00:47:35.609 --> 00:47:37.329
<v David Mondello>So we're looking at any environment right
now.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7010-0
00:47:37.409 --> 00:47:41.649
<v David Mondello>I'm wondering if there's any questions
you have about some of the other options.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7022-0
00:47:42.319 --> 00:47:45.959
<v Christopher Swatty>So if if if you could expand that right.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7014-0
00:47:42.679 --> 00:47:43.199
<v David Mondello>Or.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7036-0
00:47:46.029 --> 00:47:50.189
<v Christopher Swatty>So any environment to me and you don't
have to get too long winded.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7024-0
00:47:46.289 --> 00:47:46.489
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7035-0
00:47:50.479 --> 00:47:50.679
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7046-0
00:47:50.789 --> 00:47:55.949
<v Christopher Swatty>So multicloud host environment is kind of
vague.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7065-0
00:47:55.989 --> 00:48:01.791
<v Christopher Swatty>So host environment should be, you know,
maybe under host environment onprem or</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7065-1
00:48:01.791 --> 00:48:02.589
<v Christopher Swatty>OFFPREM or.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7067-0
00:48:02.719 --> 00:48:03.359
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7073-0
00:48:03.999 --> 00:48:04.959
<v Christopher Swatty>Physical host environment, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7074-0
00:48:05.699 --> 00:48:05.979
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7090-0
00:48:06.839 --> 00:48:10.438
<v Christopher Swatty>Or something that would equate that
because multi cloud we're talking cloud,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7090-1
00:48:10.438 --> 00:48:10.719
<v Christopher Swatty>right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7102-0
00:48:10.719 --> 00:48:15.199
<v Christopher Swatty>So AWS and Azure and and you know Google
and everybody else.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7096-0
00:48:11.359 --> 00:48:11.839
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7107-0
00:48:16.049 --> 00:48:16.369
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7134-0
00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:21.545
<v Christopher Swatty>I get that host environments to me is
kind of vague because if because I have</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7120-0
00:48:19.399 --> 00:48:19.679
<v David Mondello>I see.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7134-1
00:48:21.545 --> 00:48:25.309
<v Christopher Swatty>on Prem and off Prem so host environments
could mean.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7132-0
00:48:23.999 --> 00:48:24.319
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7142-0
00:48:26.799 --> 00:48:28.519
<v Christopher Swatty>On Prem and multicloud.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7148-0
00:48:28.519 --> 00:48:30.239
<v Christopher Swatty>So it's kind of redundant, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7151-0
00:48:30.269 --> 00:48:31.149
<v David Mondello>I see. OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7189-0
00:48:31.919 --> 00:48:37.341
<v Christopher Swatty>Edge Hardware makes sense because you're
talking about, you know, Edge routers and,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7189-1
00:48:37.341 --> 00:48:40.892
<v Christopher Swatty>and you know,
probably I would think DMZ type hardware</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7181-0
00:48:40.189 --> 00:48:40.509
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7189-2
00:48:40.892 --> 00:48:44.120
<v Christopher Swatty>and DC,
DC related things on the edge which makes</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7190-0
00:48:43.579 --> 00:48:43.939
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7189-3
00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:44.959
<v Christopher Swatty>sense I know.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7194-0
00:48:45.689 --> 00:48:45.969
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7200-0
00:48:46.299 --> 00:48:48.219
<v Christopher Swatty>What that means? IoT?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7198-0
00:48:47.479 --> 00:48:47.799
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7205-0
00:48:50.319 --> 00:48:51.719
<v Christopher Swatty>OK, but kind of vague too.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7210-0
00:48:52.169 --> 00:48:52.609
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7211-0
00:48:52.689 --> 00:48:52.929
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7214-0
00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:54.289
<v David Mondello>Those are. That's great.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7225-0
00:48:54.289 --> 00:48:56.569
<v David Mondello>That's that's a perfect loss of of just
understanding.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7228-0
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:58.089
<v David Mondello>You know what stands out to you?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7231-0
00:48:58.089 --> 00:48:58.449
<v David Mondello>What? What?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7241-0
00:48:58.449 --> 00:49:01.369
<v David Mondello>You catch your sleep on and then the last
last again.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7277-0
00:49:01.369 --> 00:49:03.832
<v David Mondello>Last thing,
before we we go to the next screen of the</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7277-1
00:49:03.832 --> 00:49:06.889
<v David Mondello>option that were listed here.
If you were coming here and you were</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7277-2
00:49:06.889 --> 00:49:10.129
<v David Mondello>trying to just make that initial
connection to some of your resources,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7277-3
00:49:10.129 --> 00:49:13.049
<v David Mondello>which of the options on this page would
you choose and why? Or?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7283-0
00:49:13.049 --> 00:49:14.249
<v David Mondello>Which option would you choose and why?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7291-0
00:49:15.329 --> 00:49:18.249
<v Christopher Swatty>So of the whole page, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7306-0
00:49:18.039 --> 00:49:22.207
<v David Mondello>Of this of this page. Yeah. Or yeah.
What would you choose as the as the way</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7306-1
00:49:22.207 --> 00:49:24.319
<v David Mondello>you would make that initial connection?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7305-0
00:49:23.279 --> 00:49:23.639
<v Christopher Swatty>So.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7319-0
00:49:25.319 --> 00:49:28.594
<v Christopher Swatty>Infrastructure huge,
assuming that slices it out between</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7319-1
00:49:28.594 --> 00:49:29.399
<v Christopher Swatty>layers, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7330-0
00:49:29.399 --> 00:49:31.319
<v Christopher Swatty>So layer one through layer 7.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7332-0
00:49:30.409 --> 00:49:32.449
<v David Mondello>Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7342-0
00:49:32.449 --> 00:49:34.289
<v David Mondello>The options in the in the middle of the
page here.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7335-0
00:49:33.319 --> 00:49:33.439
<v Christopher Swatty>But.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7350-0
00:49:34.289 --> 00:49:37.209
<v David Mondello>So like the the onboarding option, yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7357-0
00:49:34.869 --> 00:49:39.309
<v Christopher Swatty>Oh oh, the onboarding options, OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7358-0
00:49:38.729 --> 00:49:39.569
<v David Mondello>Yeah, yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7360-0
00:49:43.249 --> 00:49:43.849
<v Christopher Swatty>I think.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7373-0
00:49:45.319 --> 00:49:48.839
<v Christopher Swatty>Onboard a Windows Server with installer
to me seems kinda vague too.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7390-0
00:49:48.839 --> 00:49:53.239
<v Christopher Swatty>I don't know if that's a if that's a new
resource that I need to build.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7388-0
00:49:52.299 --> 00:49:52.819
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7394-0
00:49:53.519 --> 00:49:54.719
<v Christopher Swatty>You know what I mean?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7399-0
00:49:54.599 --> 00:49:54.799
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7397-0
00:49:54.719 --> 00:49:54.769
<v Christopher Swatty>I need to.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7402-0
00:49:54.769 --> 00:49:55.479
<v Christopher Swatty>I need to load it.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7428-0
00:49:57.199 --> 00:50:01.172
<v Christopher Swatty>The environment itself,
as opposed to it's an existing operating</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7410-0
00:49:58.589 --> 00:49:58.709
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7428-1
00:50:01.172 --> 00:50:05.879
<v Christopher Swatty>system in a box somewhere that I add.
So onboard single machine makes sense.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7429-0
00:50:06.039 --> 00:50:06.519
<v Christopher Swatty>Get it?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7431-0
00:50:06.619 --> 00:50:07.099
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7433-0
00:50:06.759 --> 00:50:07.719
<v Christopher Swatty>Use it right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7435-0
00:50:07.719 --> 00:50:09.279
<v Christopher Swatty>I can and and.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7442-0
00:50:10.759 --> 00:50:12.639
<v Christopher Swatty>Actually,
both of these speak to a test environment.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7448-0
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:15.269
<v Christopher Swatty>Two, which is very, very important.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7455-0
00:50:15.629 --> 00:50:18.149
<v Christopher Swatty>I'm boarding a single machine to
understand how to do that.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7461-0
00:50:19.679 --> 00:50:20.999
<v Christopher Swatty>Would make a lot of sense.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7475-0
00:50:20.999 --> 00:50:24.119
<v Christopher Swatty>I'd go there first,
and then onboarding multiple machines.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7468-0
00:50:21.979 --> 00:50:22.099
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7491-0
00:50:24.239 --> 00:50:27.832
<v Christopher Swatty>I dig into that because of the slice and
dice thing that I told you about.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7495-0
00:50:27.759 --> 00:50:29.079
<v David Mondello>Yes, OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7491-1
00:50:27.832 --> 00:50:28.359
<v Christopher Swatty>How do you?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7498-0
00:50:28.359 --> 00:50:30.239
<v Christopher Swatty>How do you do that by application?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7502-0
00:50:30.239 --> 00:50:31.679
<v Christopher Swatty>By location, by user base.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7519-0
00:50:31.679 --> 00:50:37.199
<v Christopher Swatty>By whatever onboard a Windows Server with
installer that to me is super vague.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7506-0
00:50:32.769 --> 00:50:32.969
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7530-0
00:50:37.239 --> 00:50:42.959
<v Christopher Swatty>I don't know if if this utility is the
installer bit it's talking about.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7522-0
00:50:37.679 --> 00:50:37.999
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7559-0
00:50:43.189 --> 00:50:48.220
<v Christopher Swatty>About or if I'm talking about building a
brand new Windows Instance and then</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7541-0
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:44.189
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7559-1
00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:49.789
<v Christopher Swatty>onboarding it, you know.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7554-0
00:50:48.439 --> 00:50:48.879
<v David Mondello>I see.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7560-0
00:50:48.959 --> 00:50:49.879
<v David Mondello>That's great. That's great.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7565-0
00:50:50.359 --> 00:50:53.239
<v David Mondello>Yep, that's a great call out, OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7581-0
00:50:53.239 --> 00:50:56.223
<v David Mondello>So I think just for the sake of time,
we got about 10 minutes left of the hour.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7581-1
00:50:56.223 --> 00:50:57.119
<v David Mondello>If we go 5 minutes over.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7591-0
00:50:57.119 --> 00:50:59.159
<v David Mondello>Is that something you could accommodate?
I'm just trying to.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7590-0
00:51:00.359 --> 00:51:00.399

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7602-0
00:51:00.399 --> 00:51:01.119
<v Christopher Swatty>I I got a hard stop.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7601-0
00:51:01.209 --> 00:51:02.449
<v David Mondello>Get a hard stop, OK, so.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7609-0
00:51:02.079 --> 00:51:04.839
<v Christopher Swatty>I've got Thursdays, Thursdays,

<v David Mondello>No, no, that's OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7619-0
00:51:05.609 --> 00:51:06.009
<v David Mondello>That's fine.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7626-0
00:51:06.449 --> 00:51:09.849
<v David Mondello>With that understanding,
let's go with the last set of screens.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7643-0
00:51:09.849 --> 00:51:14.057
<v David Mondello>So if you hit the X again at the top of
the screen just below the Connie Wilson</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7646-0
00:51:13.809 --> 00:51:14.409
<v Christopher Swatty>By Connie.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7643-1
00:51:14.057 --> 00:51:14.689

<v David Mondello>Yep.
And then at the top of the screen here.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7671-0
00:51:18.279 --> 00:51:21.571
<v David Mondello>There's some pills like right next to
Azure Arc that they help me find right</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7671-1
00:51:21.571 --> 00:51:21.999
<v David Mondello>solutions.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7676-0
00:51:21.999 --> 00:51:24.359
<v David Mondello>Did you notice this the first time we
took a look at this page?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7681-0
00:51:24.499 --> 00:51:25.499
<v Christopher Swatty>You don't know. I didn't.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7684-0
00:51:26.179 --> 00:51:27.739

00:51:28.479 --> 00:51:31.439
<v David Mondello>So I'm wondering if if yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7703-0
00:51:29.899 --> 00:51:32.259
<v Christopher Swatty>'Cause it kinda it kinda draws your eyes
right in here.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7707-0
00:51:32.259 --> 00:51:33.619
<v Christopher Swatty>And that's exactly where I want.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7708-0
00:51:33.619 --> 00:51:33.939
<v Christopher Swatty>I did.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7715-0
00:51:33.879 --> 00:51:35.799
<v David Mondello>OK, OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7710-0
00:51:33.939 --> 00:51:34.999
<v Christopher Swatty>Not even notice those.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7744-0
00:51:36.319 --> 00:51:40.602
<v David Mondello>So are those questions that you think you
might have again,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7744-1
00:51:40.602 --> 00:51:46.242
<v David Mondello>you know when you're coming to this spot
to begin to onboard resources to our,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7755-0
00:51:45.389 --> 00:51:48.391
<v Christopher Swatty>OK,
so so so the center one highly valuable</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7744-2
00:51:46.242 --> 00:51:46.599
<v David Mondello>yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7758-0
00:51:48.239 --> 00:51:50.039
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm. OK OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7755-1
00:51:48.391 --> 00:51:50.029
<v Christopher Swatty>to me because it speaks.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7768-0
00:51:50.029 --> 00:51:53.269
<v Christopher Swatty>It speaks to what will work and what
won't. What we just talked about, right.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7774-0
00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:54.079
<v David Mondello>I see. Yep.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7788-0
00:51:53.269 --> 00:51:56.661
<v Christopher Swatty>Exactly what we just talked about the

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7788-1
00:51:56.661 --> 00:51:57.509
<v Christopher Swatty>That's very vague.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7792-0
00:51:57.909 --> 00:51:59.029
<v Christopher Swatty>I don't know.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7787-0
00:51:58.019 --> 00:51:58.339
<v David Mondello>Uh huh.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7800-0
00:51:59.149 --> 00:52:01.749
<v Christopher Swatty>I don't know what that means, right?
It is.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7804-0
00:52:00.609 --> 00:52:01.889
<v David Mondello>OK, OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7828-0
00:52:01.749 --> 00:52:07.692
<v Christopher Swatty>Help me find solutions to managing my
environment or pooling resources or</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7812-0
00:52:05.079 --> 00:52:05.199
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7828-1
00:52:07.692 --> 00:52:11.949
<v Christopher Swatty>ensuring that resources are equally
balanced across.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7833-0
00:52:12.599 --> 00:52:13.239
<v Christopher Swatty>It's a very vague question.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7837-0
00:52:13.669 --> 00:52:14.069
<v David Mondello>I see.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7842-0
00:52:13.709 --> 00:52:15.869
<v Christopher Swatty>What management services can I enable?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7850-0
00:52:15.869 --> 00:52:18.749
<v Christopher Swatty>That's that's a great question.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7851-0
00:52:18.749 --> 00:52:19.989
<v Christopher Swatty>It's like what? What?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7852-0
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.429
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7854-0
00:52:20.029 --> 00:52:20.909
<v Christopher Swatty>You know what?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7862-0
00:52:20.909 --> 00:52:24.469
<v Christopher Swatty>Can I do within the arc enabled machine?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7872-0
00:52:24.469 --> 00:52:26.869
<v Christopher Swatty>Can I can I check the CPU utilization?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7881-0
00:52:26.869 --> 00:52:28.309
<v Christopher Swatty>Can I check memory utilization?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7882-0
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:29.749
<v Christopher Swatty>Can I check Nick?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7890-0
00:52:29.789 --> 00:52:32.109
<v Christopher Swatty>Can I check throughput speed?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7893-0
00:52:32.629 --> 00:52:33.869
<v Christopher Swatty>Can I check?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7900-0
00:52:34.429 --> 00:52:36.789
<v Christopher Swatty>You know all those performance categories
you can think about?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7914-0
00:52:36.789 --> 00:52:39.677
<v Christopher Swatty>So that makes sense to me that the middle
one makes perfect sense to me.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7908-0
00:52:38.199 --> 00:52:38.399
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7914-1
00:52:39.677 --> 00:52:40.469
<v Christopher Swatty>The one on the left.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7916-0
00:52:41.199 --> 00:52:41.519
<v Christopher Swatty>Very vague.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7922-0
00:52:42.289 --> 00:52:42.849
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7921-0
00:52:42.759 --> 00:52:42.879
<v Christopher Swatty>Umm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7937-0
00:52:43.009 --> 00:52:45.409
<v David Mondello>That's that's.
That's all great to to hear about,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7937-1
00:52:45.409 --> 00:52:48.289
<v David Mondello>kind of how you interpret some of the
additional questions.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7948-0
00:52:48.449 --> 00:52:51.336
<v David Mondello>What do you what would you expect to
happen if you were to click on on one of</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7948-1
00:52:51.336 --> 00:52:51.929
<v David Mondello>these questions?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7953-0
00:52:53.229 --> 00:52:55.669
<v Christopher Swatty>So this one right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7956-0
00:52:55.669 --> 00:52:57.429
<v Christopher Swatty>The middle one I like.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7961-0
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:58.949
<v David Mondello>Yeah. What would you?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7966-0
00:52:58.949 --> 00:53:00.829
<v David Mondello>What would you expect to happen after you
click on it?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7978-0
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:06.269
<v Christopher Swatty>My expectation is that it would show me
the base operating systems that.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7988-0
00:53:07.759 --> 00:53:09.079
<v Christopher Swatty>Are compatible, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7983-0
00:53:08.689 --> 00:53:08.889
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7998-0
00:53:09.199 --> 00:53:16.959
<v Christopher Swatty>And then other things like Java Patch
level security level.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/7993-0
00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:14.529
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8004-0
00:53:18.499 --> 00:53:18.979
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8027-0
00:53:18.599 --> 00:53:23.402
<v Christopher Swatty>I would think they would be the the
prerequisites would mean at a base</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8027-1
00:53:23.402 --> 00:53:27.799
<v Christopher Swatty>minimum this is what it's gonna take for
us to onboard that box.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8021-0
00:53:25.199 --> 00:53:25.399
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8035-0
00:53:27.939 --> 00:53:28.899
<v David Mondello>OK, great.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8036-0
00:53:28.709 --> 00:53:30.309
<v Christopher Swatty>And that would have a lot of components.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8040-0
00:53:30.569 --> 00:53:31.009
<v David Mondello>OK, perfect.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8056-0
00:53:31.009 --> 00:53:33.289
<v David Mondello>That's good to know.
Some of what you would expect here,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8056-1
00:53:33.289 --> 00:53:35.249
<v David Mondello>just for the sake of looking at this
experience.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8063-0
00:53:35.249 --> 00:53:36.809
<v David Mondello>Do you mind clicking on the 1st question?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8078-0
00:53:36.809 --> 00:53:40.080
<v David Mondello>Because that's what's gonna trigger a
look at some of what this interaction</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8078-1
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:40.769
<v David Mondello>might look like.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8112-0
00:53:40.769 --> 00:53:44.585
<v David Mondello>So you would be presented with this
experience where it would open up copilot</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8112-1
00:53:44.585 --> 00:53:48.157
<v David Mondello>and it would ask you a question.
And again the question that you clicked</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8112-2
00:53:48.157 --> 00:53:51.289
<v David Mondello>on was help me find the right solutions.
And this is the first.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8113-0
00:53:51.269 --> 00:53:51.989
<v Christopher Swatty>Isn't good enough.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8120-0
00:53:52.189 --> 00:53:55.109
<v Christopher Swatty>It's not good enough because you got on
Prem or cloud.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8124-0
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.989
<v Christopher Swatty>You don't have hybrid.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8132-0
00:53:57.679 --> 00:53:58.079
<v Christopher Swatty>So what?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8167-0
00:53:57.959 --> 00:54:00.816
<v David Mondello>So you. Yep. Wait,
so there's it's not you.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8137-0
00:53:58.079 --> 00:53:59.519
<v Christopher Swatty>It's it's, it's both.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8167-1
00:54:00.816 --> 00:54:05.815
<v David Mondello>You would you have resources in both and
there's no way for you to make that</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8167-2
00:54:05.815 --> 00:54:07.439
<v David Mondello>selection right now with.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8162-0
00:54:06.389 --> 00:54:06.669
<v Christopher Swatty>Can I?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8165-0
00:54:06.669 --> 00:54:07.669
<v Christopher Swatty>Can I choose?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8174-0
00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:10.269
<v Christopher Swatty>Can I choose both of them and probably
not?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8187-0
00:54:09.559 --> 00:54:12.439
<v David Mondello>That this is single select right now,
right? Yep.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8185-0
00:54:10.269 --> 00:54:12.629
<v Christopher Swatty>It's an either or, right, right.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8231-0
00:54:12.629 --> 00:54:15.763
<v Christopher Swatty>So single select.
To me you're limiting my ability to do</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8231-1
00:54:15.763 --> 00:54:20.381
<v Christopher Swatty>what I want to do because you're assuming
that it's either on Prem or in the cloud,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8201-0
00:54:16.879 --> 00:54:17.239
<v David Mondello>I see.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8231-2
00:54:20.381 --> 00:54:24.670
<v Christopher Swatty>but you're not saying, hey, guess what?
It's a shared environment and whether</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8221-0
00:54:23.049 --> 00:54:23.249
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8231-3
00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:27.749
<v Christopher Swatty>it's shared for compute storage or well,
actually comp.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8234-0
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:29.429
<v Christopher Swatty>In storage.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8243-0
00:54:30.959 --> 00:54:35.999
<v Christopher Swatty>In the cloud.
So I might have onprem applications.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8270-0
00:54:36.269 --> 00:54:40.545
<v Christopher Swatty>In servers,
but my my backup is likely going to be</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8270-1
00:54:40.545 --> 00:54:45.994
<v Christopher Swatty>have cloud components,
so a single a single select is not a good</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8264-0
00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:44.589
<v David Mondello>Yeah. Yeah. OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8270-2
00:54:45.994 --> 00:54:46.749
<v Christopher Swatty>question.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8272-0
00:54:46.329 --> 00:54:47.689
<v David Mondello>Got it. That's good. That's good.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8304-0
00:54:47.689 --> 00:54:50.323
<v David Mondello>Really good feedback.
So let's assume just for the sake of</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8304-1
00:54:50.323 --> 00:54:53.895
<v David Mondello>going through the last few screens here
that you you select onprem and what you</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8304-2
00:54:53.895 --> 00:54:55.369
<v David Mondello>would see next if you click next.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8309-0
00:54:55.689 --> 00:54:56.889
<v David Mondello>Let's take a look at that.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8331-0
00:54:57.169 --> 00:55:01.644
<v David Mondello>So you have these four options after
you've selected on Prem and I'm wondering</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8331-1
00:55:01.644 --> 00:55:05.609
<v David Mondello>is this against a single select like the
previous question are these?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8343-0
00:55:07.369 --> 00:55:09.285
<v David Mondello>Is this list exhaustive of what you would
expect to see,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8343-1
00:55:09.285 --> 00:55:10.529
<v David Mondello>or are there things that are missing?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8352-0
00:55:11.199 --> 00:55:13.199
<v David Mondello>Are the things that shouldn't be here or?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8362-0
00:55:11.369 --> 00:55:15.809
<v Christopher Swatty>I think it's. I think it's OK,
but I would.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8361-0
00:55:14.989 --> 00:55:15.469
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8366-0
00:55:15.889 --> 00:55:17.399
<v Christopher Swatty>I would make it a five question.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8370-0
00:55:17.839 --> 00:55:18.519
<v David Mondello>Oh, OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8380-0
00:55:17.999 --> 00:55:21.319
<v Christopher Swatty>Physical server.
Next question virtual machines.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8382-0
00:55:21.519 --> 00:55:22.479
<v David Mondello>I see. OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8397-0
00:55:21.919 --> 00:55:25.284
<v Christopher Swatty>Next question,
SQL Server and then SQL Server can be</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8397-1
00:55:25.284 --> 00:55:26.999
<v Christopher Swatty>physical and or virtual so.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8396-0
00:55:27.129 --> 00:55:27.329
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8404-0
00:55:28.559 --> 00:55:30.759
<v Christopher Swatty>I would separate physical and virtual
machines.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8418-0
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:33.030
<v David Mondello>OK.
And and do you mind telling me a little</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8418-1
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:34.829
<v David Mondello>bit about why you would make that
separation?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8420-0
00:55:36.229 --> 00:55:36.709
<v Christopher Swatty>Well.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8436-0
00:55:38.279 --> 00:55:42.319
<v Christopher Swatty>Because I might only wanna look at a
virtual environment, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8447-0
00:55:42.359 --> 00:55:45.654
<v Christopher Swatty>So if I,
if I understand the physical nature of</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8435-0
00:55:42.519 --> 00:55:42.919
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8447-1
00:55:45.654 --> 00:55:46.959
<v Christopher Swatty>the machines right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8450-0
00:55:46.949 --> 00:55:47.349
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8496-0
00:55:46.959 --> 00:55:49.626
<v Christopher Swatty>So they're all pure Edge Eight 50s and
you know,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8496-1
00:55:49.626 --> 00:55:54.035
<v Christopher Swatty>we've got three more years of maintenance
before its end of life and the service</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8496-2
00:55:54.035 --> 00:55:58.064
<v Christopher Swatty>life, whatever. If I understand that,
which I should before I go in here,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8476-0
00:55:54.569 --> 00:55:54.769
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8483-0
00:55:56.759 --> 00:55:56.959
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8496-3
00:55:58.064 --> 00:56:01.439
<v Christopher Swatty>I'm probably only looking at the virtual
machine. So I wanna.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8500-0
00:56:01.229 --> 00:56:01.429
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8505-0
00:56:01.439 --> 00:56:03.599
<v Christopher Swatty>Take a look at that virtual machine.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8512-0
00:56:04.599 --> 00:56:04.959
<v Christopher Swatty>And I don't.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8515-0
00:56:04.959 --> 00:56:07.119
<v Christopher Swatty>I I already understand where it where it
sits.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8517-0
00:56:07.919 --> 00:56:08.559
<v Christopher Swatty>You know what I mean?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8523-0
00:56:08.749 --> 00:56:10.029
<v David Mondello>Yeah, I see what you're saying.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8538-0
00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:12.469
<v David Mondello>OK, so let's yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8537-0
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:12.409
<v Christopher Swatty>And I don't. So so if I check.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8541-0
00:56:12.409 --> 00:56:13.769
<v Christopher Swatty>So if I check that.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8542-0
00:56:14.729 --> 00:56:14.889
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8558-0
00:56:16.039 --> 00:56:20.380
<v Christopher Swatty>File here Gale in case you're using
service principal and start to refresh</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8558-1
00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:20.959
<v Christopher Swatty>expansion.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8560-0
00:56:20.959 --> 00:56:21.359
<v Christopher Swatty>I just.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8564-0
00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:24.769
<v Christopher Swatty>I'm not sure yet.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8566-0
00:56:26.319 --> 00:56:26.519
<v Christopher Swatty>Interesting.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8575-0
00:56:29.509 --> 00:56:30.869
<v Christopher Swatty>Using a service principal.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8576-0
00:56:30.869 --> 00:56:31.429
<v Christopher Swatty>I like that.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8588-0
00:56:31.429 --> 00:56:35.429
<v Christopher Swatty>So that would be,
that'd be a policy level thing, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8604-0
00:56:35.469 --> 00:56:40.283
<v Christopher Swatty>Using a service principal,
so setting the the requirement of what</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8604-1
00:56:40.283 --> 00:56:41.669
<v Christopher Swatty>you're looking for.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8611-0
00:56:41.739 --> 00:56:43.579
<v Christopher Swatty>Infrastructure refresher expansion.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8616-0
00:56:44.989 --> 00:56:46.589
<v Christopher Swatty>At distributed location.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8622-0
00:56:49.779 --> 00:56:53.859
<v Christopher Swatty>So refresh I don't necessarily care about,
right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8629-0
00:56:53.859 --> 00:56:55.623
<v Christopher Swatty>So if I want to take a look at the
location,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8629-1
00:56:55.623 --> 00:56:57.859
<v Christopher Swatty>I'm going to determine whether we need a
refresh or not.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8639-0
00:56:57.859 --> 00:57:01.896
<v Christopher Swatty>So if I look at infrastructure at
distributed location,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8639-1
00:57:01.896 --> 00:57:04.059
<v Christopher Swatty>that to me is a good question.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8642-0
00:57:04.219 --> 00:57:05.779
<v Christopher Swatty>Refresh your expansion.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8645-0
00:57:06.139 --> 00:57:06.979
<v Christopher Swatty>We're not there yet.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8661-0
00:57:06.979 --> 00:57:10.859
<v Christopher Swatty>What if I just want to look at my
existing inventory there?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8663-0
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:11.229
<v David Mondello>OK, OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8673-0
00:57:11.539 --> 00:57:14.539
<v Christopher Swatty>I I don't want to refresh or I don't want
to.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8678-0
00:57:14.539 --> 00:57:15.419
<v Christopher Swatty>I don't want to grow that environment.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8681-0
00:57:15.819 --> 00:57:16.619
<v Christopher Swatty>I just want to see it.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8685-0
00:57:16.999 --> 00:57:17.319
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8690-0
00:57:17.419 --> 00:57:19.539
<v Christopher Swatty>Enhanced VM management lifecycle power
cycle.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8694-0
00:57:19.929 --> 00:57:21.129
<v Christopher Swatty>That makes sense to me.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8696-0
00:57:21.539 --> 00:57:21.859
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8719-0
00:57:21.979 --> 00:57:26.351
<v David Mondello>Are these all scenarios that you were
aware arc could do or are these is some</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8719-1
00:57:26.351 --> 00:57:30.779
<v David Mondello>of this kind of new information for you
on the scenarios that are listed here?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8728-0
00:57:31.439 --> 00:57:33.319
<v Christopher Swatty>No, the it's not new.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8729-0
00:57:33.499 --> 00:57:33.819
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8739-0
00:57:34.079 --> 00:57:37.919
<v Christopher Swatty>The at scale authentication familiar with
the refresh and expansion.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8752-0
00:57:37.919 --> 00:57:41.480
<v Christopher Swatty>I don't remember that because that
strikes me as strange because it's making</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8745-0
00:57:39.279 --> 00:57:39.639
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8752-1
00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:42.359
<v Christopher Swatty>assumptions, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8754-0
00:57:42.729 --> 00:57:43.049
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8758-0
00:57:43.859 --> 00:57:44.339
<v Christopher Swatty>VM management.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8762-0
00:57:44.339 --> 00:57:45.259
<v Christopher Swatty>Yeah, absolutely.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8772-0
00:57:45.299 --> 00:57:49.539
<v Christopher Swatty>I get that because that's that's what
drove me to look at it in the first place.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8764-0
00:57:45.459 --> 00:57:45.859
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8790-0
00:57:50.399 --> 00:57:53.768
<v David Mondello>And if you are coming for the first time
and starting to connect things,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8790-1
00:57:53.768 --> 00:57:55.799
<v David Mondello>which of these options would you would
you?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8792-0
00:57:55.799 --> 00:57:56.439
<v David Mondello>Would you choose?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8797-0
00:58:00.539 --> 00:58:02.739
<v Christopher Swatty>Probably 3 VM management.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8805-0
00:58:01.929 --> 00:58:04.129
<v David Mondello>Over three. OK, got it. All right.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8806-0
00:58:03.129 --> 00:58:03.529
<v Christopher Swatty>Yep.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8827-0
00:58:04.129 --> 00:58:06.785
<v David Mondello>And so for the just for the sake of
seeing the last screen here,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8827-1
00:58:06.785 --> 00:58:09.769
<v David Mondello>do you mind clicking on submit and and
we'll see what I'm sorry, submit.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8831-0
00:58:09.849 --> 00:58:11.529
<v David Mondello>Yeah. At the bottom there.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8835-0
00:58:11.159 --> 00:58:11.759
<v Christopher Swatty>Oh, got it.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8849-0
00:58:11.529 --> 00:58:14.467
<v David Mondello>And so this is what it would what it
would recommend based off of the</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8872-0
00:58:14.199 --> 00:58:17.136
<v Christopher Swatty>Click onboarding.
Generate a script on target. Yep, Yep,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8849-1
00:58:14.467 --> 00:58:15.769
<v David Mondello>selections you made previously.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8872-1
00:58:17.136 --> 00:58:19.919
<v Christopher Swatty>Yep. That's all the stuff.
This is all what I expect.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8878-0
00:58:20.229 --> 00:58:22.989
<v David Mondello>OK. And then yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8902-0
00:58:20.819 --> 00:58:25.985
<v Christopher Swatty>Generous script pointed to the target
server onboard single yes testing and</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8902-1
00:58:25.985 --> 00:58:30.676
<v Christopher Swatty>validate before. Oh that all.
I like actually testing and validation</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8891-0
00:58:29.879 --> 00:58:29.999
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8902-2
00:58:30.676 --> 00:58:34.619
<v Christopher Swatty>because just because you build it doesn't
mean it's good.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8904-0
00:58:35.039 --> 00:58:35.159
<v David Mondello>Hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8916-0
00:58:36.159 --> 00:58:40.879
<v Christopher Swatty>And to just because it's even though it's
good, it doesn't mean scalable, right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8926-0
00:58:41.119 --> 00:58:44.079
<v Christopher Swatty>So is it part of a server pool you know
is it?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8929-0
00:58:44.079 --> 00:58:45.639
<v Christopher Swatty>Is it a load balanced environment?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8935-0
00:58:47.319 --> 00:58:49.479
<v Christopher Swatty>That would be valuable to know.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8941-0
00:58:49.909 --> 00:58:50.909
<v Christopher Swatty>Is this ready?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8957-0
00:58:50.909 --> 00:58:54.507
<v Christopher Swatty>Is this ready to be load balanced or
added to an application pool across</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8957-1
00:58:54.507 --> 00:58:55.789
<v Christopher Swatty>multiple physical servers?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8959-0
00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:57.149
<v Christopher Swatty>That would be important to know.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8964-0
00:58:57.519 --> 00:58:57.719
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8968-0
00:58:58.639 --> 00:58:59.399
<v Christopher Swatty>Insurance compliance.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8973-0
00:58:59.399 --> 00:59:01.719
<v Christopher Swatty>Absolutely. Number four, 100%.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8987-0
00:59:01.799 --> 00:59:05.679
<v Christopher Swatty>I I think that's something that we don't
really do as well as we should.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/8983-0
00:59:06.099 --> 00:59:06.699
<v David Mondello>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9003-0
00:59:06.119 --> 00:59:09.849
<v Christopher Swatty>So setting assuming we can set security
policies policies,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9003-1
00:59:09.849 --> 00:59:11.999
<v Christopher Swatty>you know like minimum patch level.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9004-0
00:59:10.719 --> 00:59:11.079
<v David Mondello>Yep.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9008-0
00:59:13.679 --> 00:59:14.239
<v Christopher Swatty>File scanning.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9018-0
00:59:16.479 --> 00:59:18.623
<v Christopher Swatty>You know,
malware detection and all that other</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9018-1
00:59:18.623 --> 00:59:19.079
<v Christopher Swatty>stuff, so.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9025-0
00:59:19.979 --> 00:59:21.139
<v Christopher Swatty>That would be valuable.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9031-0
00:59:20.229 --> 00:59:22.749
<v David Mondello>So I I want to be a sensitive time.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9035-0
00:59:22.749 --> 00:59:22.989
<v David Mondello>I know you have.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9042-0
00:59:23.149 --> 00:59:24.749
<v David Mondello>We just have a little minute left jisu.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9063-0
00:59:24.749 --> 00:59:28.709
<v David Mondello>I'm sorry I didn't leave more time for us
to ask questions, but jisu do you have?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9054-0
00:59:25.279 --> 00:59:26.599
<v Christopher Swatty>Sure. No.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9058-0
00:59:26.599 --> 00:59:27.879
<v Christopher Swatty>It's OK. No, it's OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9076-0
00:59:28.709 --> 00:59:31.229
<v David Mondello>Do you have a question that you'd like to
ask a participant based off some of the</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9076-1
00:59:31.229 --> 00:59:32.029
<v David Mondello>stuff we've covered today?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9115-0
00:59:32.819 --> 00:59:36.489
<v Jisu Park>And maybe one last question,
after looking at all this experience,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9085-0
00:59:34.229 --> 00:59:34.749
<v David Mondello>Yeah.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9115-1
00:59:36.489 --> 00:59:40.980
<v Jisu Park>if you were to make a decision to onboard,
what else information do you think you</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9115-2
00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:44.979
<v Jisu Park>will still need to dig through and find
more about in the documentation?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9129-0
00:59:45.659 --> 00:59:49.299
<v Jisu Park>Or do you think you have a sufficient
information to make onboarding decision?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9120-0
00:59:46.099 --> 00:59:46.139
<v Christopher Swatty>I.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9173-0
00:59:49.569 --> 00:59:53.340
<v Christopher Swatty>I think I have good information to make
onboarding decisions.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9173-1
00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:57.719
<v Christopher Swatty>The the questions I would have and I keep
going back to the same theme,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9141-0
00:59:53.889 --> 00:59:54.089
<v Jisu Park>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9173-2
00:59:57.719 --> 01:00:01.125
<v Christopher Swatty>right pooling.
So determining how you how you slice and</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9173-3
01:00:01.125 --> 01:00:05.809
<v Christopher Swatty>dice and how you manage and maintain your
resources. That to me is would be.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9183-0
01:00:05.809 --> 01:00:06.809
<v Christopher Swatty>Exceedingly valuable.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9188-0
01:00:06.809 --> 01:00:08.569
<v Christopher Swatty>So onboarding no question.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9199-0
01:00:08.569 --> 01:00:11.188
<v Christopher Swatty>So you're asking about minimum patch
level security level.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9199-1
01:00:11.188 --> 01:00:12.209
<v Christopher Swatty>All those other things.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9203-0
01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:12.969
<v Christopher Swatty>These are compliant.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9216-0
01:00:12.969 --> 01:00:16.062
<v Christopher Swatty>These aren't,
you know what I said to David about</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9216-1
01:00:16.062 --> 01:00:19.279
<v Christopher Swatty>showing what operating systems are
compliant or or.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9223-0
01:00:19.779 --> 01:00:21.539
<v Christopher Swatty>Are onboardable right?</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9224-0
01:00:21.539 --> 01:00:23.019
<v Christopher Swatty>That would really help.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9245-0
01:00:23.099 --> 01:00:27.111
<v Christopher Swatty>And then also you know the Java or the
security patch level and those things</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9245-1
01:00:27.111 --> 01:00:31.279
<v Christopher Swatty>that here's our minimum requirement to
onboard bang right there in front of me.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9264-0
01:00:31.739 --> 01:00:33.502
<v Christopher Swatty>So I can look at a server and say all
right,</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9264-1
01:00:33.502 --> 01:00:35.539
<v Christopher Swatty>I'm not even gonna try to do this because
it's not.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9269-0
01:00:35.539 --> 01:00:37.259
<v Christopher Swatty>It's not compatible yet.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9272-0
01:00:37.499 --> 01:00:38.459
<v Christopher Swatty>We need to upgrade.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9276-0
01:00:41.959 --> 01:00:42.479
<v Christopher Swatty>It's pretty.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9283-0
01:00:42.279 --> 01:00:42.759
<v David Mondello>So.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9280-0
01:00:42.479 --> 01:00:43.359
<v Christopher Swatty>It's pretty intuitive.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9293-0
01:00:43.399 --> 01:00:45.799
<v Christopher Swatty>I mean the whole onboarding bit is,
is super intuitive.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9298-0
01:00:45.799 --> 01:00:47.479
<v Christopher Swatty>That's just that's the intuitive part.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9305-0
01:00:47.519 --> 01:00:49.359
<v Christopher Swatty>Now the question is the downstream value.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9309-0
01:00:49.399 --> 01:00:50.319
<v Christopher Swatty>That's where I'm focused.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9307-0
01:00:49.539 --> 01:00:49.739
<v David Mondello>Mm hmm.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9317-0
01:00:50.919 --> 01:00:53.079
<v David Mondello>Perfect. Well, Chris, I really appreciate.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9325-0
01:00:53.079 --> 01:00:54.079
<v David Mondello>I know you have to to scoot.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9345-0
01:00:54.319 --> 01:00:57.987
<v David Mondello>I sent in the chat a link to the form.
If you wouldn't mind just opening that up</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9345-1
01:00:57.987 --> 01:00:59.119
<v David Mondello>so you have access to it.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9368-0
01:00:59.159 --> 01:01:03.371
<v David Mondello>It's a 3 short questions in the in the
chat there and you don't obviously don't</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9368-1
01:01:03.371 --> 01:01:07.479
<v David Mondello>have to fill it out right now if you have
to run, but it's 3 short questions.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9392-0
01:01:07.479 --> 01:01:11.354
<v David Mondello>Just kind of reflecting on what we took a
look at and and highlighting where you</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9376-0
01:01:07.959 --> 01:01:08.319
<v Christopher Swatty>OK.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9392-1
01:01:11.354 --> 01:01:15.039
<v David Mondello>think we need to improve the most,
but I really appreciate all the feedback.</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9394-0
01:01:14.499 --> 01:01:15.179

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9416-0
01:01:15.849 --> 01:01:18.695
<v David Mondello>And reflection on your experience.
And then also on the stuff we put in</v>

8292d02e-6e6e-4b02-80d5-69c8b6903ff0/9415-0
01:01:17.689 --> 01:01:18.369
